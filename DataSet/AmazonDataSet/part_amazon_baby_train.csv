"My Brest Friend Slipcover, Leaf",I bought this cover as a spare for my pillow and it is not as well made as the original cover - the fabric is thinner and the seams do not fit the outline of the foam pillow very well. It's still usable though. Okay for the price.,3
"Safety 1st Steady Grip Infant Clipper, Colors May Vary","The clipper blades don't seat properly, so they don't cut cleanly. The ergonomic design should have made this a great product, unfortunately Safety 1st's manufacturing was poor.",1
Sliding Closet Door Lock 2-Pack,This baby proofing item does not stick well at all. It fell off door and took some paint with it. It's a wast of money. If the item would stay in place it would be wonderful but it's not!!,1
DEX Products Electric Baby Food Processor,"I really like this product.  I have 3 children and never used a food processor until now (my 3rd baby).  I realize I spent so much money on jarred foods that I didn't need to.It was simple, put the food in (you can add a little liquid if you want it smoother - but i found it wasn't absolutely neccessary).  Push the top down and presto - in about 10 seconds you have baby food.easy to clean, comes apart very easily and goes back together easily.There are only 4 parts- the container the food goes in, the blade, the cover and the motor.  Nothing to lose.I reccomend this product to anyone who is short on time (3 kids (12, 3, 8mos), my husband and I both work full time +, swimmng lessons, 2 pets,  needless to say we got alot going on and making the food actually makes life easier w/ this product!",4
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,Excellent buy except for one thing: The height adjustment needs to be extended. My grandson will be able to use it for only about two months unless I employ a method of shortening the hanging strap that is outside what the jumper itself provides. Not cool.,4
The Shrunks Indoor Toddler Inflatable Travel Bed,My 4 year old loves sleeping in her own bed when we go on vacation!!It is the perfect size for her and doesn't take up much room in the car.,5
Bumble Bags Kimberly Tote Bag Blue Latte,"This bag is exactly what I wanted. One of the big plusses is that it has lots of room with lots of compartments. I had the bag for 3 weeks before I realized it had an inside zippered compartment lol When I saw the changing pad was attached with velcro, I figured Id never use it (I never use the other ones so I figured this was no different). Wrong. I love that changing pad lol I can put the diaper bag on the end of one of those plastic changing tables like in Target, pull out the changing pad, and I have everything accessible to me! It's also really soft and pliable so its not bulky at all. Oh, and another good thing about this bag is that it isnt forever falling off my shoulder. Nothing is more aggrevating than carrying an infant carrier and a diaper bag and the diaper bag keeps sliding off your shoulder. No problems with this one! Plus it fits on my stroller wonderfully! I have a Peg Perego and it fits perfectly.",5
Bummis Super Whisper Wrap Diaper Cover: Medium (15-30lbs),"This is the first cover I've tried and it's great.  I don't plan on trying others.  It leaked the first time I used it because I hadn't adjusted it properly but since I check the fit, no leaks!!  I use cloth while at home to cut down on costs.  I don't recommend them for overnight...but if you want something affordable for during the day this is a winner.",4
"Leachco Safer Bather Infant Bath Pad, Blue Fish","We used this product for my son's sponge baths when he was first brought home.  He loved these baths so much that we actually put off tub baths for quite a while.  It turns out he loves tub baths too!  We actually used this on our changing table (with waterproof lap pads over it, so as not to get it too dirty) for his early changings because while he loved sponge baths, he hated having his diaper changed.  This tactic definitely helped.  It's also very portable if you have to give baths over at Grandma's - it can be used in a sink!  Most people haven't heard of this product, so it makes a great and unique shower gift.",5
Tommee Tippee Electric Steam Sterilizer,"I bought this sterilizer because 1) I had great results with the Tommee Tippee bottles; 2) I was tired of having to boil said bottles.The only reason why I'm no giving it five stars is the fact that after a few uses, the center pole that holds the upper tray (for the nipples and lids) is bending at the notch that latches it to the lower tray (that holds the bottles.) As long as it doesn't completely go on us in the future, I can live with that. Apart from that, great price, great results, gets the bottles sterilized in five minutes, and it's a breeze to use. You put the bottles, nipples, and lids in, you press the on/off button, and five minutes later, the machine shuts off on its own. Then it's a matter of waiting for the machine to cool down and you're ready to go. I'd definitely recommended to other people.",4

He seem so comfortable with the soft  fabric that he dozes off soon after we take off!The only comment I have is that when we placed the seat at the backseat of my sister's Lexus SUV, due to the slope of the backseat, the carseat appears to be be upright rather than reclined,and I'm sure we've adjusted it in the right reclined position as recommended on the instruction for rear-facing, thus his head slumps forward...",4
"Skip Hop Grab &amp; Go Wet/Dry Diaper Bag, Chevron","This bag is good quality that actually surprised me when I got it.  I guess I expect most wet bags to be more cotton feeling and lighter while this one feels pretty sturdy and robust.  I really like the dry part of the bag is mesh so that I can easily see what I have in there.  I have had times where I have forgotten things in the dry part of the bag because I didn't remember that I had anything in there.I would compare this to Planet Wise Wet Dry Bag - Owl for size.  It will easily fit about 4-6 dirty cloth diapers in it (I mainly use bum genius for specific reference).  The outside pocket doesn't give a lot of room for cloth diapers, but it would be good for one or two or a change of clothes.Great wet bag that would be great for a day out with cloth diapers or even better for use at the pool.  I know I will be using this a lot this summer.",5

Boon Squirt Baby Food Dispensing Spoon in Orange,"It is a bit bulky in order to hold a full jar of baby food (4-5 oz). The squirting works very well, especially for liquid-y food. However, the rather deep spoon is very close to the tank, and in order to completely empty the spoon my baby had to bump his nose right into the tank. I don't know any solution to this problem, since a longer 'neck' would also mean a hard-to-clean food pipeline running through (right now there's a simple hole between tank and spoon).I was enthusiastic when i saw the product the first time, but used it less than expected on a daily basis.",4
Orbit Baby Toddler Car Seat G2 - Black,"I absolutely love all of the orbit g2 line except for this seat. i have had many car seats for my kids and this is by far the bulkiest, least ergonomic seat i have ever purchased. I should have heeded the 3 star warning. the angle at which the seat is makes it hard for my son to get comfortable to sit let alone nap. He screams miserably everytime he sits in it. its very very cramped also. the head pads on the side are huge. its really disappointing bc i have spent all of this money and it will be taking a trip to our local charity having never been used longer than 5 minutes. its really that awful. i really hope they come out with a better design bc the product is very nice looking. it just doesnt work well at all. sorry orbit but i am very disappointed hope you come out with a roomier better angled seat for my next one.",2

Fisher Price Soothing Massage Bouncer,"I just bought this bouncer, and I wished I had bought it weeks ago!  My baby doesn't like me to put her down, and when I do to try to get things done around the house, she cries, and it drives me nuts to just let her scream!  So I got this bouncer, and the first time I put her in it, I turned on the vibration and the back massage, and she fell asleep immediately!The things I love about it are:1) The vibration doesn't turn off--it stays on until you turn it off.2) The back massage is a really nice feature--it is very gentle, I put my hands on it to see what it felt like.  My baby loves having her back patted, so this soothes her instantly.3) It has a handle on the top, so if your baby falls asleep in it (which WILL happen!), then you can just pick it up and carry it to the nursery, your bedroom, etc.4) It has really nice high sides, so my newborn's head doesn't flop around--she can rest it up against the side and snooze away.5) The toys are removable from the velcro tabs and can be used to give your baby a massage.  My baby really likes the rattle toy, and I feel like I can really interact with her when I shake it.  And when the toys are hanging from the velcro tabs, she just loves batting at them!I only have a couple very minor gripes:1) I wish the toys hung down in front of her face.  There are only velcro loops for the toys on the sides, so the rattle just rests against the side of the bouncer and doesn't rattle unless I manually rattle it for her.2) The motor is sooooo quiet (which is great!), but it's easy to forget that you have it turned on, then you run down the batteries.My baby takes her afternoon nap in this every day.  As soon as she falls asleep, I can just carry it to the nursery where she takes a nice 2 hour nap uninterrupted!  Plus, the music is not annoying and loud, like on many of the other bouncers out there.  Definitely worth the money to buy this product!",4
Lotus Travel Crib and Portable Baby Playard,"What a wonderful product! It does exactly as advertised- light weight, very quick setup and comfortable for baby. My daughter is 15 months old and not little- she is very long like daddy and I was worried that her crazy sleeping patterns might wake her up in a smaller crib, but she did great. We just got back from 10 days in Mexico (three different hotels) and she slept every one in the Lotus without a problem. I did use a memory topper since she has one at home, and she is old enough that I don't have to worry about suffocation. I am not one to bash another company, but I will say this is my second travel crib after first buying the one that sets up like a tent (thinking it would pack in the suitcase easier) is a total waste of money and finger nails!! Buy this for vacations and trips to grandmas you will not be disappointed!! When baby number 2 comes along I will buy the bassinet. Thank you Lotus for making a product that makes traveling with small children easy.",5

Kalencom Potette Disposable Liners - On The Go Potty Liner Re-Fills,I would recommend this to any family potty training or traveling.  We've even used it at the park when the toilets were closed.  We always have ours in the trunk for emergencies.  Fairly compact & quite sturdy.  Even my tall DD didn't have a problem using it in a pinch.,5
"WhodaThought Mrs. Smith's Elite Diaper Bag, Pitch",I received this bag as a gift. It is stylish but too girly for my husband to carry around. It holds a lot of stuff. I used it to travel on a cross country flight with a 5 month old. There are 3 insulated compartments for bottles. The drawer on the bottom is ingenious! It made everything really easy to find. Yet I find myself putting this diaper bag away for something else. I think that it is too big for everyday use. The backpack feature is really uncomfortable and makes it difficult to get into the back pouch when using it this way. The zipper on the top broke. I contacted the company and never heard from them in regards to this. Disappointed :  If the company had gotten back to me I may have given it 4 stars.,3

"Summer Infant Lil' Loo Potty, Pink","I bought a few potty's for over $20 to no success. I love this potty b/c:Pros:1. IT's CHEAP! Yes, I can afford to have 2 of these around our house to make it easy for her to use it2. Nice little urinal that's deep enough to compensate for possible splash back up for #2s; it's quite deep compared to  other potty's on the market3. Easy to clean4. Simple. It is simple without all the bells and whistles, making the child concentrate on doing their business. With other potty's my child was more interested in pressing the buttons than actually peeing in it :(5. Did I mention it's CHEAP! lolCons:1. B/C it's so easy to clean and pick up...it's also easy for my DD toddler to pick up as well--so when she does pee...she has picked up the urinal portion and spilled it around to show me her successful attempts!! :) So if you are training your kid, maybe try to incorporate not letting them pick it up after.I'm glad I got this potty--and so happy my DD is excited to use it!",5

"Joovy Caboose Stand On Tandem Stroller, Black","We have had this stroller for about six months and is has been a life saver.  My husband is currently away on a military assignment and I have to manage the kids by myself.  The eight month old loves to be able to sit and have a tray for toys.  There are two cup holders on his tray so one can be used for him and one for his brother.  My three year old loves all the options this stroller gives him.  He can sit, stand or hold on to the bar and walk beside it.  In fact all I have to do to get him back in the stroller is to say he will be strapped in if he doesn't come.  It is very important when they stand on the back to have them hold on to the handles and have the support strap up.  The basket is hard to get to but I use my son to get things in and out of it.  He feels very important doing that.  I appreciate the independence my son is learning and at the same time the control I have to keep him safe.  The zoo has never been so easy and fun... not to mention shopping.",5

Ive even went to best buy to buy a 'universal adapter' to replace it w but they are $41 each and i need two. Im not paying $80 on top of the $300 i just paid for these. I cant believe they would make such a great product w such an obvious flaw. It would work fine for a non-mobile baby but for that much $ i think u should be able to get some 'toddler-use' out of it too.",3
Chicco Caddy Stroller in Navy,"I got this stroller because my 70 yr old mother in law who comes over to my house to watch our 5 month old daughter, wasn't able to maneuver the big travel system stroller we have. This stroller has been a total relief for her and my daughter loves it!!  The only downside to it (as I am sure is with a lot of smaller umbrella type strollers) the shade canopy doesn't provide a lot of shade protection from the sun, so we have to be very careful to keep out of the sun. Also, this stroller is not meant for very tall people, such as my husband who is 6'2"", as he has to lean over and often finds himself kicking the wheels. It is just perfect for my mother in law and myself who are 5ft and 5'1"" though.  Overall, this is a very sturdy stroller at a reasonable price!",4

"American Baby Company Heavenly Soft Chenille Fitted Contoured Changing Pad Cover,Ecru",This is a lovely changing pad cover. Quality make and super soft! Not the kind of soft that goes away with washing either. My only critique would be the placement of the safety strap wholes. They are awkward. Otherwise fabulous product.,4
"Super Undies! Bedwetting Pants, The Web Slinger (Red), Small","Our son has only been able to get around these, not through them. So these have saved washing the bed numerous times. I consider them a must have, but make sure that they are all the way up and positioned correctly.",5
"HALO SleepSack 100% Organic Cotton Wearable Blanket, Cowboy, Small","The bag is pretty soft and light. The material seems good quality. The zipper has a cloth backing to not bother your child's skin, however, it stops short of cover the start of the zipper by your child's chin. The metal part has some relatively sharp and uncomfortable edge. I wish Halo stepped it up and made a cover for that part like the Grobag.",3
"Infantino Twist and Fold Activity Gym, Vintage Boy","I purchased this for my three month old son and he and I love it!  It is beautiful and very user friendly.  At three months he doesn't do much other than look around at all the colors and animals.  But since we have purchased it he has gotten motivated to reach out for the objects in front of him.  I love the pop up and fold up design, all though it is so beautiful I rarely fold it away!  It has extra loops to attach other items to it, which I love.  All in all I am 100% happy.",5

"Gerber Graduates BPA Free 2 Pack Fun Grips Soft Starter Spill Proof Cup 2 Handle, 6 Ounce, Vertical, Colors May Vary","After a lot of looking around the ""sippy cup"" aisle, my 7 month old daughter and I decided on these cups.  They are going back to the store.  It is impossible to line up the spout evenly between the two handles.  There is little point in having a cup with handles if the spout ends up sideways and right above your baby's hand. I think we might look for a trainer cup without handles.",1
"Razbaby RaZ-berry Teether, Red","This is a great teether.  My baby loves it.  She plays with it all the time and she does not seems to get tired of chewing on it.  The material is not too hard or soft and is just perfect to soothe baby's gums.  The teether has lots of texture in the design.  I have seen my daughter chew on the textured raspberry part, the ""leaves"" and even the handle as it too has a textured design. I love this one!!  On a side note, one of my other kids must have put this in the freezer the other day - I would not have tried to do that just because I wouldn't know if it could get damaged like some of the other teething toys out there.  It was fine and the baby seemed to enjoy it fresh out of the freezer too.",5
"ElecRosa Electrical Outlet Cover, Ivory",Absolutely love these! Clean look and unobtrusive. I did order these twice and the more recent ones are easier to slide open; almost too easy. I'm going to have to monitor things closely as baby gets stronger. IMPORTANT: these are only for outlets with one central screw as you can see in the pic. I was bummed when i went to install these in my kitchen also and only then realized those that outlet covers require two screws. Check your outlets for this issue before ordering.,5
"green sprouts Silicone Freezer Tray, Green","Given that every other type of ice cube tray that doesn't leach chemicals is expensive, this product is the best option. Just be aware that it does not work like a typical ice cube tray where you twist it and the cubes spill out. The cubes need to be pushed out from the bottom with my fingers and my hands get cold in the process. So they are kinda annoying. But it's worth it for the price and the non-leaching material. Let me know if anyone can find a BPA/Phalate/PVC free traditional ice cube tray under $8.",3
The First Years Soothing Diaper Rash Cream,"Bought for my daughter for her diaper rash. Rash is usually gone after 2-3 applications. Very good product. Would highly recommend.

"Boon Groovy + Modware Interlocking Plate and Bowl Set with Utensils,Blue/Orange","These plates are small but so is my child so it doesn't bother me. The plate, spoon and fork all measure 5 and 1/2 inches. The bowl is 4 inches with 3/4 inch sides and the larger of the two small blue bowls holds 1 tablespoon of liquid. Having the food separated into small dishes keeps new eaters from having to chase their food around. The little dip containers are movable and the whole deal has a great nonslip ring on the bottom. The fork and spoon are also non-Slip so even wet hands can grip them.",5
Sassy Earth Brights Wooden Happy Caterpillar Toy,"This is one of my favorite Earth Brights toys!  The caterpillar has a fabric head that squeaks if it squeezed(or chewed on), the middle links are wood and have fabric ""legs"", the back end also has fabric legs that crinkle and the there is also a tail, these fabric pieces are great because they have different textures and colors.  My son loves the smiley face too!  The lack of plastic is always a plus.",5
"Baby Aspen Let The Fin Begin Terry Shark Robe, Blue, 0-9 Months",I recently bought this for my 2 month old.  He is somewhat long and lean but not abnormally so.  This is surpisingly small.  It says it fits 0-6month but it barely covers his rump or goes around him.  It's very cute but he does not like it becuase he gets cold after his baths because so wet skin is exposed.  It's also not as soft as i would have expected.  It's a terry cloth but not the softest.,2
"Joovy Spoon Walker, Greenie",My grandson's still a small for it so he's only able to sit in it and occasionally row backwards when his toes brush the floor. The size is a little bigger than I had thought so it takes up more room than I would like so it gets stuck in places.,4
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey","A lot of reviews say that the stickiness of the tape isn't that great, and it isn't- but so far it's not a problem. The guards are great because we have a fake stone fireplace so the edge is much more uneven than brick, but the guard works great. A definite for anyone with a fireplace and a squishy little handful of a baby :)",5
"Boon Benders Adaptable Utensils, Blue Raspberry/Tangerine","These are the perfect size and shape for getting your 6 month old started on food.  My LO was able to grip the spoon and fork easily just shy of 6 months.  I had to put on the sweet potato, papaya, etc. but she was able to get the food into her mouth. It's also great that she's able to practice with cutlery while we're all having a meal.  Even if she's not trying everything we're having she can participate.",5
Girl Newborn Bibs 3 Pack in Lilac / Pale Pink / Fuchsia,Just what we needed but don't expect to use them long. Babies will outgrow the smaller neck size very quickly. Comes with two snaps and our newborn was unable to even use the one for smallest fit.,4
"Dream On Me / Mia Moda  Atmosferra Stroller, Nero","I recently bought this to replace a Chicco Cortina which I'd never really liked but was decent and capable so I felt stuck with it.  But I'd grown increasingly hung up lately on the notion of a rear-facing stroller.  Most people seem to think of it as a feature for smaller babies, but I really wanted it for my 2.25 year old who is talking a ton these days.  When we go out with the stroller she is chattering and singing and asking me questions nonstop in her sweet little voice and I couldn't hear a word she said when she was facing away from me.  I'd seen rear facing strollers around town and assumed they were all crazy expensive but was pleased to find that there were a few mid-priced options available, and finally settled on the Atmosferra.So far, I am very pleased.  The steering is much smoother and easier than with the Cortina.  One-handed steering is really important to me, as I sometimes have to take the dog and stroller out at the same time.  I've never pushed a $1,000+ stroller and probably never will, so I although I wonder if those strollers feel $800+ better to push than this one, I'm satisfied.Love the easily adjustible handle.  Unfortunately, it does rattle a bit as one walks.  Don't like that, as it gives what seems an otherwise sturdy stroller a rickety feel, but perhaps that is common to all telescoping-type handles?  This is the only one I've ever tried.My daughter seems to like the seat and the deep canopy (hates sun in her eyes and this one really blocks sun well).  She also LOVES her snack tray and the cupholder, which keeps her sippy cup firmly in place.  At about 36"" her head is at the top of the seat frame but that doesn't seem to bother her at all because she's always leaning a bit forward to look around, rather than resting her head on it.  I'm sure I could rig up some extra padding if it becomes a problem. Not a deal breaker for me.  The canopy arches higher than the top of the seat frame, so it clears her head with room to spare.When folded, the stroller is VERY bulky and the huge rear wheels jut out, but from our research we knew to expect that.  We plan to use this one only for walks around our city neighborhood, and keep an umbrella-type stroller for the rare occasions we want to take a stroller in the car.  The reason for 4 stars rather than 5 is the trickiness of the fold.  I had to watch the babygizmo video review several times to figure it out and even though I now understand how to do it, it is pretty finicky and definitely is a two-handed fold.  My husband is afraid to even try because he's watched me struggling with it. The seat also must be facing forward to fold the stroller.  Turning it around before folding is a mildly irritating extra step, but I think that may be a common issue with rear-facing strollers.We are hoping to have a baby #2 at some point and I am really excited to try out the basinette feature.  I spent a while going back and forth between this and the Contours Options 3-Wheeler because the Countours is compatible with our Chicco infant carseat but the Atmosferra only accepts Mia Moda's carseat.  The Mia Moda won out in the end because I like that you can make a snug flat basinette out of it, whereas the Countours seat does not go flat.  I think between the basinette and our trusty Ergo carrier and Sleepy Wrap, our hoped-for second baby will make out just fine.  ONE NOTE ABOUT THE BASINETTE:  we got Nero which must be an older color becuase it is cheaper.  The babygizmo video shows a ventilation panel when the seat is fully reclined but our stroller DOES NOT have the ventilation panel.  Not sure whether that feature was just on certain model years.  Wanted to point that out for anyone for whom it might be important.Overall, this is a stylish-looking, versatile stroller and I think it's a pretty good bargain for the price.  If your lifestyle is such that you are constantly in and out of a car, this may not be the best choice, because it's heavy and bulky and has limited travel system compatibility.  I'd recommend it for city dwellers who tend to get around a lot on foot.***Update June 2012****So, we've had this stroller for a year, had our second child, and have put the stroller through its paces.  It has held up well.  It steers really easily, even if heavily loaded with a 3 year old and a basket full of groceries--I can push the baby in it one-handed while holding my older daughter's hand with the other. Daughter is still comfortable in the seat, at age 3 1/2 is pretty much maxing it out height-wise, but doesn't complain.Regarding the bassinette feature--I really like it better than the Chicco travel system which I used when my daughter was a baby.  It seems much cooler for baby during these hot summer months than being strapped into a carseat, and he can nap flat on his back or sit semi-reclined and watch the world go or look at me as we stroll.  The sunshade is awesome.  Switching the seat from bassinet to regular configuration is a bit of a pain, though.  The snaps involved are very stiff and hard to reach, and I do struggle with them, which can be frustrating when I'm in a hurry to get somewhere.  So keep that in mind if you anticipate having to switch it back and forth frequently.Overall, still satisfied with the purchase!",4
Swing Seat Ikarus,we have owned 2 of these (haba sent us a replacement after the first one broke).  its a very comfortable swing but the stitching simply does not hold us to heavy use.,1

Hohner Kids Baby Band,This is one of those toys that I could play with my one year old for hours. He loves it as much as I do.,5
Star Kids Snack and Play Travel Tray,"The tray is a nice size for coloring or playing in the car but because it has to be soft for safety reasons it is a little floppy and doesn't really stay flat.  It worked nicely for us on a very long (17 hour) road trip with a 2 year old.  It has buckles on the sides so you can tighten it once and then just release it to make a pit stop.

Baby Bath Tub Ring Seat New in Box By BabyMoov,"Oh it is great, my granddaughter at 8 months has a little problem sitting up and this works great for her in the bath. Getting to big to be in the sink.  Its fun to see her in the bath and having a good time.",5
Baby Einstein Sea Dreams Soother,"This thing works great. Has nice tunes and is soothing and entertaining to the baby. Babies are so individual in what they do and don't like. My baby likes it, but I wouldn't say she's mesmerized by it. She watches it for a bit then looks at other things. I do like that you can just turn on the ocean sounds for white noise. She does fall off to sleep well with it. As for those saying its loud, it starts off kind of loud but the speaker is pointed out the back of it so it a not as loud to the baby as it is to you. It does get quieter as it goes on. I like that it slowly gets softer before shutting off. I haven't used the remote as my baby is usually asleep by the time it shuts off. As of now the music and fish don't soothe her to sleep as much as they just keep her entertained in her crib while I do something else. I like that you can turn off the light and just have the sounds. Overall I like it and I'd buy it again. It's not some miracle baby soother, but it's cute and does the trick.Update 6/5/2014STILL love this soother. My baby is now 1 year old and loves this even more now that she's older. She can now turn it on and off by herself and she falls asleep to it every night. When she takes naps, sometimes she'll wake up, turn it on, then go back to sleep all on her own. She loves to watch the fishes and listen to the music. I've still never bothered with the remote. She pretty much tunrs it on and off herself so I don't need it. Still works great and for as much as I use it (every day) the batteries last a pretty decent amount of time. I've never had an issue with it falling off or coming undone. The latch is very secure. She bumps it constantly, hold onto it while standing up in her crib, and hits it. Never once has it come loose or fallen off. It's very sturdy. I'd say of all the gadgets I've baught for my daughter, this is on the top 5 list. Definitely worth the money.",5
bumGenius Diaper Sprayer,"At first I was taken aback at how powerful the sprayer is, even when turned on low.  I had a couple of incidents with water all over the bathroom, but once I got used to it, I love it!  I would suggest taking a couple of practice runs with non-poopy diapers first.  Then once you get the hang of it, it works wonderfully.  It easily sprays all the solids in the toilet and you don't have to do any soaking or dunking!  I would recommend this to anyone using cloth diapers for their babes!",5
Portable Toddler Seat Belt,"This is perfect for carrying in a purse or diaper bag to use in restaurants.

Zutano Owls Musical Mobile,This mobile is really cute but it misses the idea of a mobile. Jthe music would last less then a minute so unless you stay close to relaunch it each time it stops or you better just call it crib decoration that is actually more interesting to adult then the babies. The view they have from the crib is not that interesting !I was disappointed by the product!,1

UPPAbaby G-Series Rain Shield,"This rain guard is great if your child doest not have legs, or if your child is so small that their feet don't pass the length of the stroller seat. Otherwise it's pretty useless. If your child's feet stick out, the cover can't attach well at the bottom, and the slightest bit of wind pulls the cover up from the bottom and over the top of the stroller, splashing all over whomever is pushing the stroller and exposing the child to the elements. Searching for something else.",1

"Stokke Sleepi Crib, White","Overall, I think the structure and look of this crib is wonderful. The biggest drawback have been the wheels. The set of wheels that came with the crib would not stay in the lock position (2 out of the 4).  I often find my son's crib in the center of his room, because he's able to move it. We have hardwoods and are now considering purchasing a pad for under his crib to keep it in place. I called the company and received pretty good service. Stokke sent me a set of replacement wheels. Even though they know my crib is walnut colored they sent me white wheels. I can live with white, except that again one of wheels is not staying locked. So today I went to retrieve my son from his crib and again it was in the center of the room and close to his bookshelf. We are now thinking of removing the wheels all together. Honestly, despite what we do like about the crib (size, versatility, look), you can find just as nice of a crib for less money. I will not purchase again.",3
"OXO Tot Seedling Youth Booster Seat, Green","This booster seat is easy to clean, folds up easily, and takes up very little space.  The green seat removes easily for cleaning, but I have a bit of a hard time getting it back into the chair properly.  My only concern is that this works well for older toddlers...those who are capable of sitting in the seat of their own accord.  This is not a seat that can be used with a kid who can't sit still in the seat for an entire meal unless a seat belt is used, or able to get themselves in and out of the chair on their own.  There is nothing holding the booster to the chair, so again, could be  safety concern with a wiggly toddler.  So for now, this chair sits on the floor for my daughter to use when she plays.",3

Kalencom Quick Change Kit Chocolate/Blue,"I was really hoping to like this, but when I first received it what I noticed is how ""tall"" it is and was worried about it not fitting my purse and diaper bag. It's also very narrow when you open it, and I just don't see myself positioning the baby perfectly in the middle so they won't touch the surface beneath it. The diaper pouch and wipes case are a nice addition, but they swing out from the changing pad on the sides right about where the baby's arms would go. This is not optimal if you have a small space or the changing area is against the wall - that pouch/pocket would just flop over onto baby.",2
Bummis Super Lite - Blue - Newborn,"I bought this cover about a month ago--medium, for my 15 lb 3.5 month old.  Some of the reviews made me weary, but for the price, I thought I'd give it a shot.  I'm not a huge fan of hook and loop, but they seem to provide a better fit for my little moose.  So far, we have had NO leaks and I have used it overnight on him.  During the day, we use prefolds, flats or applecheeks inserts.  At night, I use kiwi pie fitteds--12 hrs, no leaks!It does seem that poop gets on the cover every time, so we just plan on a cover switch out when that happens.  I've had no issues with moisture on the legs when it's just a wet diaper.I'm going to give the one we bought a few more months of use, and plan on buying more when he grows out of his current covers.",4
Infantino Cozy Rider,"This is my 4th carrier. My son is 3 months old, 17 pounds. I have a sling, a hip sling and a snuggli-the stripped down model. I got this one because I needed something that I could wear for extended periods with my baby facing out that would not restrict my movement too much. I bought it used, without instructions. I had no trouble figuring out how to use it. There are a number of adjustments to be made, but you only have to do it once, until your baby grows enough to move to the next setting. I made all the adjustments myself, with my baby in the carrier. It is a lot easier to get him in and out of than the the regular inward facing snugli. there are little buckles and velcro on the sides that you can undo to get baby in and out. I like that I didn't have to force my baby's feet into the holes, there is plenty of room for even big chunky thighs. A lot of people have complained about how hard it was to get baby in and out, but I don't know what they are comparing it to. I love that I could adjust everything to fit my baby perfectly. The carrier is soft and cozy. My baby felt safe and secure. My only complaint is that there is no waist strap, so I did feel a little strain in my back, and I felt a bit front heavy. Aside from that I think this is a really great carrier for the price. The only comparable brands cost more than 3 times as much. I think it's a really good deal.",4
"Tadpoles Organic Cotton Pin-Stripe Kimono-Style Bodysuit, Sage, 0-3 Months","i expected kimono style to be the kind where one side tucks in under the other side and snaps to the inside while the top layer snaps to the outside. this is actually just a snap front that snaps at a skewed angle, with no overlapping pieces. that was disappointing to me. but otherwise it's a great bodysuit. also 0 the color is not like photo (i got the green one). the color is actually sage like the description, and not teal/aqua like the image",3
Tiny Love Sweet Island Dreams Mobile,"My 2 month old son LOVES this mobile! I was hesitant to purchase it since I really didn't want to risk wasting money on yet another baby product but I was very pleasantly surprised with this mobile. First of all the mobile is really great quality, very colorful, adorable and just generally well made. The music is very soothing for both baby & parent plus it has nature sounds which also has some soothing music playing behind it. The animals rotate individually at random times as the mobile moves which really helps to keep my son interested. Another great feature is the remote control. The music lasts for 20 minutes and usually by the time it turns off he is asleep but if not we can restart the music from the doorway without going into his room and disturbing him.Overall this product is a must! I originally purchased a $50 wind up mobile but aside from keeping him interested for a few minutes it really did nothing for us. It would play for a few minutes and stop, he would scream and we would have to go and wind it back up again thus disturbing him and starting the whole process all over again...this mobile avoids all those issues and helps baby learn to self soothe!As a first time mom I HIGHLY recommend this mobile!!",5

"Evenflo Big Kid High Back SI Car Seat Booster, Alexa","At least at the lowest height setting, the seat belt comes out of the slot where it's supposed to be held at the shoulder all the time. My son often scoots forward, almost off the seat and is not secure at all.  I'm going to have to change him back to a harness style. He is not secure in this car seat.  Might be ok for an older child. He is 3 and at lower end of weight requirement. But I have another booster this same style but made by a different company that is much more secure.",2
"Summer Infant Poshpouch, Pink/Brown","I am a ""research-aholic"" in general and have researched many different baby products over the past 5 years due to being a mother of 3 and wanting to get the best for the price and not wanting to settle for less...  I live in the Northeast US, so it gets really cold and the weather changes frequently and in extremes on a daily, if not hourly basis.  Anyway, here are the brands I've used/owed and/or researched extensively and the comparisons:Jolly Jumper Arctic Sneak A Peek Infant Car Seat Cover (JJA)Jolly Jumper Sneak A Peek Infant Car Seat Cover (JJ)Summer Infant Poshpouch (SP)Cozy Car Seat Microfiber and Fleece Cover (CC)Baby's Cozy World Microfiber & Fleece Carrier Cover (BC) (yes the CC and the BC are different)JJ Cole infant/original bundle me (JJC)JJ Cole toddler bundle me  (JJT)OK...Jolly Jumper Artic (JJA) is awesome, I would rate it the best one out of all.  It is a ""shower cap"" cover for the infant car seat, it has a blanket inside that you can velcro closed to keep the baby's face covered and warm and you can velcro it ""up"" to stay open when the baby when you put the baby in the car out of weather's elements...  It has two zippers which allow you to open the carrier and easily access the baby, keep the baby from over heating and you can also ""flap the middle piece down to keep it completely off the baby.  The blanket is a nice feature of this cover.  You can use it alone with the flap open on a warmer day and you can also ""flap"" it down away from the baby as well when not in use.  Another nice thing about the blanket is you can wrap it around baby to keep them warm, there is enough material on both sides to do this..  Some reviewers of this and other carriers stated that there were gaps around the handle, this is true of mostly all the shower cap covers except you can adjust it to cover these gaps.  Also you can take the wrap around blanket and cover the baby as well as feed it through the gaps on the sides to close them if the cover cannot be adjusted to fit around the bottom to close that area.  The outer portion is nylon, like a jacket and it is waterproof, the fleece is substantial and it keeps the infant very, warm. This is an expensive carrier but well worth the money!  This is top notch!Jolly Jumper is just like the carrier described above but without the attached blanket.  Again, overall an excellent carrier.  It is not that much less than the JJA and no matter what climate I would pay the extra money for the JJA just because you can use the blanket alone with the flap of the outer portion of the JJ out and it is a very nice feature to have in the cover.Summer Infant Poshpouch (SP) is another ""shower cap"" cover for the infant carseat but it has an opening in the top with no flap to velcro over baby's face.  I owned this before the JJA and here are some differences.  It is a much thinner material, the fleece isn't as substantial and the outer portion is not waterproof or nylon but a fleece polyester material.  The opening is rather large and I felt as though breezes/wind would go right through the hole and it is definitely not as effective in making the baby too warm, esp. in colder conditions.  To remedy this problem I put a blanket on under the cover and the baby seemed better on 30 degree days from the house to the car but not to take a walk.  I also had to put a hat and make sure the blanket was high on baby to cover the baby's neck or use something to make sure baby's neck was covered due to the hole being so big.  It also gaps more on the side then the JJA and the JJ.  The SP only has one zipper to unzip the baby when inside.  And when you want to keep the baby inside the carrier, you really have to take the whole thing off to leave the baby in to not be covered.  And it is hard to get the baby out without pushing it aside.AND MOST IMPORTANTLY ******* PLEASE SEE*****  it was very scary when I discovered that when you place it on correctly and put it over the infant carseat, I would put my infant carseat into the holster and it WOULD NOT, I repeat WOULD NOT lATCH INTO THE BASE!!!!  There was no way of knowing this unless you checked, (I check my baby each time to make sure the carseat is latched in just by habit), but it would not even be partially latched just completely unlatched....  I felt this was unacceptable....  Even when I tried to adjust it by pulling the bottom portion where the baby's feet would be up, the cover b/c of the elastic would just come up, bunch and be partially off with a gap under the baby's feet so I feel this carrier is a COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY.  I paid 2/3 the cost of the JJA.Cozy Car Seat Microfiber and Fleece Cover (CC) A lot of people think this is the BC and it is the same price but it is not.  It is a cheap spin off of the BC even though it is the same price.  The fabric is less substantial, it is honestly more like the SP.  Not worth the money and don't make the mistake of getting it.Baby's Cozy World Microfiber & Fleece Carrier Cover (BC) Is BABY'S COZY WORLD uses a type of microfiber called microsuede, which is a soft fabric made from synthetic fibers that are an imitation to suede.  It seems like it is a good bang for your buck coming in around twenty dollars which is half of the JJA.  The only thing is if you live in a really rainy climate I don't think it would be as waterproof being microsuede as the JJ or the JJA material.  Another reviewer stated that the BABY'S COZY WORLD is reversible (which I am not sure how it can be reversible deeming that it does have a flap that goes over the infants face like the CC, JJA and JJ)?The reviewer also stated that the BC has pacifier clips, which would be a nice feature for toys as well and that is is very thick for all weather and it is the same price as the CC.  ONE THING that many reviews said about the CC and the BC is that the zippers can be dangerous b/c they line up in the same place as a newborns eyes and have the potential for scratching the cornea.  With the JJ and the JJA the zippers do not seem as though they would reach this far.  Maybe the CC and the BC have larger zippers that might spin around in opposite directions esp if it is ""reversible"".  It does have the zippers on both sides to unzip and expose the infant nicely when inside and do not want the infant to overheat while in the carrier.  For the price this seems like it would be a good carrier as well and I would rate the the BC a close second and very comparable to the JJ but does not have a blanket feature like the JJA.JJ Cole infant/original bundle me (JJC)is what I owned with my first child who was a premature infant and I only got about 7 months of use out of this cover.  That is why I got the toddler JJ cole after.  It is a different type of carrier than all the others that are reviewed above being that it is not a shower cap style it has an underside to the carrier that is placed under the harness straps and then a layer goes over the baby and is zippered down and around the bottom.  FIRST OF ALL THIS IS DANGEROUS, which I never knew as a new mom, and why they even CAN SELL them as carseat covers is beyond me because if you get into an accident it compresses under the infant because of the added bulk between the seat and the child, (it is like the infant is wearing a jacket) so there is more room in between the harness and the infant deeming it unsafe.  Also, JJ cole now has the lite JJ cole and says that it passed crash tests but The Bundle me Lite's openings do not come anywhere near the hip straps of the harness... meaning they would be improperly routed, thus creating slack.  Here is a picture:[...]  No certified carseat technicians recommend this aftermarket product for the carseat.  Any many if not all carseat companies state if an aftermarket product is used ""inside"" the carseat between the harness and baby it will void all guarantees for safety.  NOT GOOD.JJ Cole toddler (JJT)  Had this mostly with my first child and second and would not use now d/t the same reason above with the JJ.  But it could be nice with a stroller.  The only thing is you do need a hat and something to cover the baby's neck as well.In summary:#1The Jolly Jumper Artic (JJA) wins the race, I am very very please with this product, esp the blanket aspect that I think is well worth it!The JJ is basically the same product as the JJA but without the blanket....#2The Baby's Cozy World Microfiber & Fleece Carrier Cover (BC) (but make sure it is the BC and not the CC when you purchase it) comes in a close second esp for the price!Hope this review is helpful to you and you now won't have to go through the countless hours of research and will be getting a great product while not wasting any of your time or money on another worthless baby item!!!!",1
"Nuby Silicone Teether with Bristles, Colors May Vary",I have tried multiple teethers including the gel ones which you can freeze.My kid always picked this up for soothing his gums. He would love to bite and pull along the bristles which I guess gives a gentle massage to his gums.I have seen it work on cranky nights when he couldnt sleep due to teething. After trying various things we thought it might be teething pains and handed him his nuby teether. Voila after biting the teether for sometime he was able to soothe himself.,5
BRICA Super Scoop Bath Toy Organizer,"I read these reviews before I bought it. I haven't had any problems with the suction cup at all. Since I've put it on it hasn't fallen off once. My 3 yr. old son picks up the scooper by himself and he's kinda rough with it, but still hasn't fallen off. Make sure you have plenty of water on the suction cup as well as on the tile you are going to stick it to. Push securely and it should stay there.Right now we have a plastic boat about 7"" length, 2 Disney Cars floaters and the entire foam alphabet as well as numbers from 0-9 all within the scooper. It drains great and all toys air dry keeping mildew and other residue off.Great price, great scooper.",5

The search continues...",2
Maclaren Quest Mod Stroller,"First, this delivery was incredibly fast, especially for an APO shipment.  Second, I wish I had gotten this stroller a heck of a long time ago.  It's replacing a Britax Esprit umbrella stroller that is impossible to steer one-handed, or sometimes even two-handed.  It's a beautiful stroller, great height, nice basket, folds easily, the carry strap will be enormously helpful, fairly light, etc.  I'm very happy with it and wish I hadn't been so ""economical"" the first time I looked at umbrella strollers for travelling with.",5

Lamaze High-Contrast Discovery Shapes Activity Puzzle &amp; Crib Gallery,"My son is just under a month old, and loves this toy.

"Evenflo Triumph Advance LX Convertible Car Seat, Harbortown",This car seat has met our needs very well.  Our child became to big for his infant seat at 7 months so we needed a car seat that could still grow with him i.e. front and rear facing.  He sustained a neck injury at birth so comfort was also a concern but we didn't have the money to spend on a Britax.I love this seat because:* Most everything on the car seat is straightforward and easy to use* In rear facing there are 3 adjustable recline settings* In forward facing 2 adjustable recline settings are available.  We still use the most recline we can to help with sleeping in the car and all around comfort.* 5 point harness fits snug and secure* Harness buckles are not too tight and difficult to use like some cheaper car seat models we have tried.* Though the built in pillow doesn't prevent his head from slouching to the side during sleep it offers a nice padded and safe wedge to hold his head up when a blanket roll is placed beneath it.* He is very comfortable in the seat.* The shoulder straps adjust as needed for the child's growth but also remain snug even though they are adjustable.* Safe up to 50 Lb.Improvements could be made on:* The shoulder straps by the neck have no padding and can become abrasive the the baby's neck.* Obviously a better instruction manual.* The cup holder is floppy and kind of worthless.He is old enough to be forward facing now and the seat provides a nice height for him to enjoy the outside world but also be snug within the car.  We drive a Chevy Malibu.  This seat is worth the extra $20 to $30 you might spend on a cheaper model.,5
Benbat Travel Friends Total Body Support,I really like the idea of this body support being reverseable to use for both warmer and cooler temps.....and all in all I think that the product is good.  my only downside is that I wish the head support piece was secured with more than just velcro.....my daughter yanked that thing off in a matter of no time!,3

My baby still has a semi flat head and I dont notice much difference since she started using this pillow. Will give it more time.Product was delivered ahead of schedule which is always a great plus!",3

Clevamama Clevafeed,"How brilliant is this thing? For over a decade, I've been getting my babies those Munchkin mesh bag feeders, because they were the only option. Those bags were a huge pain to get clear of food and ultimately had to be tossed and replaced with extreme frequency. Clevafeed is just perfect. The silicone feeder top is removable and fits right in a dishwasher basket with you bottle tops. You sacrifice a little room for food inside the feeder top compared to the mesh bag feeders, but I'd much rather refill this feeder than constantly replace mesh bags. This product is a total winner for me.",5
"Eddie Bauer Strap Cover Buddies, Monkey",We initially used this for the straps but we found out that this can also be used to cover the bare metal parts of an umbrella stroller near the head section and thus protecting the baby from head bumps there.,5
"Sassy Go Go Bugs, Styles May Vary","We love these, and have one velcro'ed to the stroller bar at all times. It's long enough that our 6 month old can grab and hold it (and the velcro keeps it from flying out of his hands, onto the filthy street). We keep one in the baby bag, just 'in case' we need a distraction -- and the third one is clasped to our baby bjorn carrier. When baby is facing in, it's fun way to keep him occupied. (Even though the directions say not to machine wash them, we've washed these many times in cold water, and they're fine)",5
Lambs &amp; Ivy Lollipop Jungle Lamp with Shade and Bulb,I got this lamp for my daughter's nursery and it is absolutely perfect. It is so cute and a great size for her dresser. I am very happy with my purchase.,5
"NUK TrendLineOrthodontic Pacifier, 6-18 months, Colors May Vary , Styles May Vary, 2-Count","I have ordered many Nuks in the past years for my kids. They're the best pacifiers in my opinion, because I find they stay in the mouth easiest. However, I've ordered the wrong size before, so I thought I would clear it up. Nuk sometimes uses size, sometimes uses age, but here's how to correlate the two:Size 1 = 0-6 monthsSize 2 = 6 - 18 monthsSize 3 = 18+ monthsThe nipple (or teat as they say in the UK) on the size 3 is huge. Your child may not necessarily like what is ""prescribed"" for their age. Ours will only take a particular size, and his age had nothing to do with it.",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,"I had such high hopes for this bouncer....I mean, I actually wanted to sit in it myself after seeing all that it could do.  But wouldn't you know it, I was sadly dissappointed upon receiving it.  My 3 month old son loves fun and games but would only sit in this chair for 10 minutes max.  The toy bar would constantly hit him on his legs and knees; he just could not sit in it comfortably.  Not sure how the baby on the box did...Additionally, for those who have ""nosey"" babies like mine, this chair may not work so well.  If sitting on the floor in his bouncer, my son could not see my face observing him while I was on the couch, therefore he would want the bar removed since some of his vision was being blocked.  Once the bar is removed, all the ""fun"" is gone and the chair gets real boring real fast.  Also I think he was a bit overstimulated between the lights and sounds on the bar at times and he would cry for me to take him out.  I thouhgt it was a fluke at first but after he did it a few times, we gave up.  Overall we tried this bouncer for about 2 weeks and today I am sending it back.  It's cute and seems to be a great idea, just poorly designed.  I hope you all have better luck with it.",2
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt",I have seen many Pack 'N Plays but this one is adorable and most functional. It has so much color that any baby wouldlove it. It is easy to put up and take down so a real added plus as we only use it about once a week. Very pleased.,5
"Withings Smart Baby Monitor, White",This has been an aweful product for us.  It has TONS of technical glitches and they don't have a tech support number!  Only way to contact them is through email which they take forever to get back on.  There have been several times now that we have had to go without a baby monitor b/c it's not working properly and don't know how to fix it.,1
"Bunnies by the Bay The Original Cuddle Coat, White, 3-6 Months",I bought this for my grand daughter.  I didn't know about the size but it fit her last year for Christmas and she wore it this Fall.  It still is just darling...very sweet.,5
"Sunshine Kids Seat Belt Pillow, Grey","This is nice but does not prevent the head from falling.  However, it is fabulous for the safety from seat belt injury to the neck in case of accident.  Went back and bought 2 more for my nieces",4
Cloud B Twilight Ladybug - Pink,"This was a gift for my 5 year old daughter, who loved it! She kept it on her bed and turned it on every night at bed time. She has had it for a little over 3 months and it just stopped working. Obviously, I tried new batteries. No luck. We were very disappointed that a toy so gently used already gave out. Buyer beware!",1
"Mommys Helper Juice Box Buddies Holder for Juice Bags and Boxes, Colors May Vary",These little juice box holders do the job but the picture is super deceiving. Please update the picture to reflect the fact that you only get one. Read description carefully.,2
Medela PersonalFit Breastshield (2) Size: Large (27 mm) Non Retail Packaging #87077,"This item works with all Medela pump accessories and is ideal for lactating women with larger nipples.  I ordered several of the breastshields to have several sets of pump attachments to use at work.  I ended up pumping several times a day and realized I could use the same pump accessories each time (over a 8 hour period) if I stored all the parts in the fridge.  However, I discovered that ANB BABY charges a 20% restocking fee on any returned items (hence the 2 stars).  Only purchase from ANB BABY if you're sure you need the items (or don't mind paying the restocking fee on any returned items)!",2
"Football Touchdown - Leg Warmers - for Infant, Baby, Toddler, Little Girl, Boy","Everyone, but most importantly my baby loves these leggings. They make changing diapers a snap while still providing warmth. Every time he wears them we receive many compliments, and they make for a fun game day ensemble.",5
"Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow, Ivory",I LOVE this pillow everyone should have one really does help back and hip aches and everything else and it's just really confterable,5
"Philips AVENT Hard Spout Magic Trainer with Handle, 9 Ounce, Twin (Colors May Vary)",Magic Cups work well & helped train our new little one how to sip!  The best part is that you can take the entire thing apart and clean throughly (unlike other sippy cups).,4
"Peg Perego Primo Viaggio SIP 30-30 Extra Base, Charcoal","For any multi-car family, it's great to have a spare car seat base for the convenience. There's not much to say about features, except that it does the job,  `nuff said!The seat is a little pricey, but if you shelled out for the Peg Perego infant seat, you probably knew what you were getting into.  Despite the price, I'd definitely buy it again.Made in Italy, good craftsmanship.Over 80% of infant car seats are installed incorrectly. Do your baby and yourself a favor and have your car seat installation inspected by an NHTSA-certified inspector. Find a free inspection location at [...] I used the site to find a local police station with an NHTSA-certified officer that verified the installation for both my family cars.",4
"Bumkins Reusable Sandwich and Snack Bag, Bright Blue, Large","This is a fantastic little snack bag. Very sturdy and can hold a decent sized serving of your child's favorite snack. I actually use it to hold extra nipples for my little guy's bottles. I have a wet bag by Bumkins that is like a super sized version of this. It has held up beautifully with repeated use and almost daily washings. Oh, and they are machine washable! I toss them in with my cloth diaper laundry, air dry, and they are ready to go in the morning. Love it!Best part? They are environmentally friendly. I know those disposable plastic sandwich bags don't take up a lot of room in your trash can, but think about all the kiddos who have one or two in their lunch boxes. That adds up to a TON of waste in our landfills.  Pick up a few of these and reduce your carbon foot print. Bonus that these are way cuter than any plastic sandwich bag :)",5
"Trend Lab Dr. Seuss Wall Clock, ABC",My granddaughter loves it. And my son and daughter in law love it because it even has a second had which they thought was really neat! They are looking forward to teaching her time.,5
"Dr. Brown's Designed To Nourish My Dot Storage Labels, 72-Count, Colors May Vary",These are great. They stay on but can be removed easily. I've had no problem with them in the freezer. Use a marker to write on them - a pen will not do it.,5
"North States Superyard Play Yard, Grey, 6 Panel","Our little monster (9 month old) can't get to breakables but our older kids get in and play with him.  We got a full setup + 2 extra pieces and they all match, work together properly & we can relax without chasing him around every minute.",5
"Thermos Foogo Leak-Proof Stainless Steel 10-Ounce Food Jar, Pink",I was looking for a thermos that actually worked.  This fits the bill.  It has not leaked in my kids lunchboxes.  It does keep food hot (provided you follow directions and preheat with hot water first).  I also bought the pink and it has functioned the same way. I plan on buying another for myself.,5
Graco Nasal Clear Nasal Aspirator,"I started using the Graco aspirator instead of the manual ones when my baby could crawl away from nose suctioning.  She loved the distracting melodies and would bop along with the tune.  Nose cleaning was a no tears time!  By the time we made it to her second cold, the motor stopped working.  The music still played, but there was no suction.  I tried fresh batteries & cleaning the unit but nothing would work.  I ran out to purchase another one since the first one worked well at first.  I used it for one cold and it stopped suctioning, but the music plays!Both times the aspirator was stored in the little protective bag that comes with it. I took the batteries out so they wouldn't drain and the other parts were cleaned and disassembled prior to storage.",2
"Munchkin 2 Pack Fresh Food Feeder, Colors May Vary",my daughter hates these and wanted nothing to do with them! they are not easy to clean either and your options are pretty limited as to what you can put in them. bananas are pretty much the only thing that makes sense to put in these feeders. the netting was a huge turn off to my daughter. i don't blame her. the texture of the netting is not appetizing and would deter me to eat from it as well.,1
HABA Piro Clutching Toy,Some of the pictures I saw on line of this toy were much bigger than the actual toy.  I did not notice any measurements in the descriptions and was surprised that it was so small for the price.,3
Earlyears Fill n Fun Water Mat Toy,This was a great toy for a very sick baby. She was having so much fun playing on the cool water filled mat.  Highly recommended by grandma.,5
"Graco Affix Highback Booster Seat with Latch System, Atomic",Was looking for an easy to latch and safe booster seat for my 4-year-old grandson.  This one actually can be latched and hooked to car same as prior car seat vs. some of the other ones that just sit on the seat and you merely belt in the toddler.  Feel it is safer and still easy to belt them in.  Like the cup/snack holder on the side.,5
"aden + anais Muslin Stroller Blanket, Jungle Jive","First of all, I have to say, I'm addicted to Aden & Anais products.  I swear I have more muslin blankets than the average mom, but they are so soft, its a must!This blanket is quite large 44x44"", its like two of the muslin swaddles sewn together.  Its large, yet airy.  My little girl sleeps with just this on, during hot summer nights.  It seems after each wash, the blanket just gets softer and softer.  The colors are delicate and do not fade with washes.  I think this blanket is better than the Dream (Dream is much thicker), as the Dream gets a little frazzled due to all the layers.",5
"timi &amp; leslie Charlie 7-Piece Diaper Bag Set, Light Brown",I got this bag for my sister for her third baby and we all loved it.  The compartments are perfectly placed and sized.  She especially love the mini wristlet for when she runs out without the kids.  The only negative was it had a small black dot on the front which was barely noticable.  I couldnt return due to time constraints so I gave it to her anyway.  Turns out she didnt care about it and kept it. Aside from that she speaks so great about it and I would reccommend it to anyone.  The quality of the leather is beautiful and it sure beats all the other diaper bags I have had and seen over the years.  Great design!  I thinking I need one for myself even though kids are 3 & 7.,4
"Safety 1st OnBoard 35 Adjustable Infant Car Seat Base, Black","Since you have to have the base for the baby seat to click into this particular one gets very sticky because of the continued use and marks up.  I realize that it's a base and hardly seen, yet you do see it, when you remove the baby seat from it's base.  I guess it's just another item to be cleaned and not particularly an attractive base for it's purpose as a baby seat.  The other problem in this one is that it cannot work when reversed as having the baby seat face the seat in front of him or her.",3
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","great product!  Our 2 year old grandson has a star-type light at his home, but he was going to be visiting us.  this cloud blue turtle is sweet as a stuffed- type toy, but great as a star projector/light.  he loved it!  we totally recommend it!",5
"OiOi Baby Leatherette Tote, Black",It's great it has space for everything and you don't feel the weight. Love it !!!  Really stylish. I order it in black and looks like regular purse and feets any size sippy cup  on the side packets !!!,5
"Skip Hop Moby Bathtub Elbow Rest, Blue","This is nice because it helps to keep my arms off the hard tub, but it slips around and doesn't stay stuck to the tub at all. We still use it every bath time,but I'm wondering what i'm doing wrong. I DO love the fact that I can take off my rings each time and it has a little zipper compartment to put them in. Love that!",4
"The First Years 4 Pack Take And Toss Spill Proof Cups, 10 Ounce, Colors May Vary",I wish it came with more travel tops. Love these cups.,5
"Lansinoh Soothies Gel Pads, 2 Count","These little pads are amazing!  Sad they don't last longer and wished more came to a package.  They work though which is what really matters.  Would, and likely will, buy again.",5
Turtle Family Bath Sets(set of 4) - Floating Bath Tub Toy,"Like the other reviews, I have to say I don't get it, but my kid is nuts for these turtles! She puts as many toys on as she can, takes them all off, and repeats. Over and over...But she doesn't use them as squirties, and the big one has a kinda large opening, and is tough to squirt all the water out(have to fold in half!!) I'm going to dry and maybe plug the hole with glue, keep her from taking on water. But I would recommend these, your kid will love them!",4
"Sugarbooger Set of 3 Good Lunch Snack Sack, Flutterby","There should be another plastic bag with this set and not just one for the price. Also, the most important thing to know about this is that none of the bags completely seal to a close (even in plastic bag) and they all leak. All my clothes got wet because of the strawberries and grapes after washing. I will continue to buy regular ziploc bags.",1
"Babiators Unisex-Baby Infant Ops Junior Sunglasses, Black, Small","These are great, lightweight and my 2+ year old loves them and looks cool in them.  After owning them for just 3 months, we lost them at the beach.  As promised, if you lose or break the sunglasses within the first year, they will replace them...AND THEY DID - no questions asked.  All you have to do is pay for shipping (which for our location was $5.00).  Totally worth it!  Just remember to register them when you get them so you can take advantage of their guarantee!",5
"Playtex Drop-Ins Pre-Sterilized Soft Bottle Liners, 8-10 oz. 100 ea","I don't get the purpose of these since the air goes right back in during the feeding(got the special Playtex nipples and bottles). Also, the store brand ones do the same thing for half the price. Walmart ones are not as soft, but do the same thing still",2
"Kolcraft Lite Sport Lightweight Stroller, Blaze",I am in my 70s and keep our great-grandson often.  I found that I just could not handle the large baby buggy.  A friend gave me her lightweight buggy and I love it!  It is so easy to handle and it has most of the features of the larger buggies.  It's so easy to set up and folds easily and fits in the back car seat.  The sun shade alone is worth the affordable price.,5
Piyo Piyo Baby Nail Scissors in Yellow,"I've been using a nail scissors since I'm a baby ( I'm in my 20s now) and I can say nothing can be compared to it.Nail clippers always hurt my thumb because one needs certain amount of power to push it down to clip the nails and nail clipper is actually not good for the nails as it traumatizes it.-----PROS-o  With a nail scissors I can cut my nails according to the shape i want with ease. Everything is done in less than 30s. *snip snip*-----CONS-o  Pricey! I can get one back in my country at US$1.50 but I need one here now so I bought this. There are other cheaper variations off the net but Piyopiyo has been a childhood favorite of mine so what the heck. BTW I bought it at $6.50. I saw that the price is now changed to $6.99 [O_O]&#34;o  Small! I have a small hand so it is just nice for me :) But for GUYS who wants to use it, I don't think they are able to. Or will be able to with much difficulty.",5
Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing -  Nature's Touch N1973,"My son loves this swing (he is 10wks) and its the only thing he will sleep in. I love how cozy the seat is and how it fully reclines so that he can sleep lying down. I havent used the toy bar yet since he is still so small and just lies in it so far, i love that you can remove it. The mobile and mirror are wonderful. He loves looking up at the mirror, it keeps him occupied for quite a while. I also like that there are several sound/music choices. I like how you can switch the swinging motion but honestly, my son only really likes the normal front to back swing.The one thing that I HATE HATE HATE HATE with such a passion, is the fact that the music and mobile turn off after a few minutes. Oh my word it is the bain of my existence! Ok a little dramatic, but seriously. Some people may like it since it could be timed so that once the baby falls asleep it turns off. Not me though. My son startles awake every time it turns off if I dont jump up and hit the reset button fast enough. I really dont understand why there isnt an option for it to be on constantly. It is also very large and takes up a lot of space. The other thing is that I wish it could have an AC adapter so that you could plug it in. It uses 4 D batteries which are expensive and dont last as long as I would like.All in all this is a great swing that could be 5+ stars with a little improvement. I would definitely choose this one over the other types of swings.",4
"Swaddlebees Capri Cloth Diaper Cover SNAPS (size 2, Marina)","I am very impressed with these covers. My daughter is 7 months and about 20lbs with most of that in her thighs. It has been an experience trying to diaper her!I have been using primarily Flips with padfolded flats, and I really like them. But, the giraffe print got me and I had to order one of these.On the smallest setting, the size two is a great fit. I have it on the waist and leg snap setting shown in the stock pic, and its a perfect fit. The rise of the cover on the largest setting gets much higher than the Flip - I think these will truly last all children through potty learning.I usually gravitate towards aplix diapers for the fit, but the only one in stock in giraffe at the time was snaps so I bought it, and I am so glad I did. These covers don't have the stretchy tabs that the Flips do, but the snaps are configured brilliantly and the fit is excellent. There is no pulling or gaping and no wing droop.The Swaddlebees Capri cover does not leave red marks on my daughters legs, and the snap down rise does not add bulk. I am using these with a large (35x35) padfolded flat on the smallest setting and I fit it under leggings. I would say that the Flip is a trimmer cover under clothes, but I would not describe these as bulky - they lay well under clothing. I also tried it over a pinned premium prefold, and it covered all of the prefold - the Flip covers are too narrow through the bum to cover most pinned prefolds without considerable tucking.Of course, the point of a diaper cover is to contain all wetness and messes - the Capri rates 5 stars in those areas, too. I have yet to have a leak or a blowout.",5
Jolly Jumper Arctic Sneak A Peek Infant Car Seat Cover Black,"I live in VT and I love that I can put him in his car seat without getting him all bundled up.  This keeps him very warm, sometimes I have to take his hat off because he is sweating in the seat!  I would recommend this for cold winters.",5
Evenflo Single Breast Pump,My dual electric pump broke after 7 months so I didn't want to buy another big pump since this was my last baby.  Another friend recommended this small pump and for $30 I went for it.  I've used it a handful of times and it works really well and love that it was so inexpensive.  I would recommend it for a casual user.,4
Chicco Cortina Stroller (Fuego),"We got this stroller as a baby shower gift to go with our Chicco KeyFit 30 carseat, and it has worked wonderfully. The best part about this stroller is the ease of use - the folding handle really can be done with only one hand if needed. Unlike another reviewer, we have not had any trouble with handling/steering and we have taken this stroller everywhere! It even held up on a recent vacation to the beach - no problems steering or mantaining movement on unlevel sand. While there are times that a smaller stroller is needed (the Chicco Liteway is our choice), we still use this stroller on a very regular basis. It has great storage space under the seat, multiple cup holders, a fully padded reclining seat, and a mult-positional handle for parent's comfort. We also like that the tray insert can be easily removed for cleaning since my little one is messy. We wouldn't change a thing about this stroller.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","this turtle is adorable and my daughter (2 years old) was amazed when i turned it on.  all 3 colors show up on her ceiling just fine.  the only reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because i wish it had the option to stay on all night. and would be even better to have the option to plug it in instead of using batteries.  I need to have an additional night light in her room because she gets scared if she wakes up in the middle of the night and there is no night light.  when she gets older, i'll let her keep it by her bed so she can turn it on by herself if she wakes up. she's not old enough for that yet so it stays on the dresser.",4
"Lambs &amp; Ivy Enchanted Forest 6 Pc Baby Crib Bedding Set, Green","This set made a beautiful addition to the nursery now waiting for a favorite niece's little girl.  Also, bought the mobile to match.  It all looks great.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","Stars do not move, no music to play. Only faint light projects stars onto the wall.  It's hardly interesting.",1
"Graco Safe Seat Infant Car Seat, Ionic",I used to work in a hospital with moms and babies and I helped many people get their babies in the car seat for the first time. I became very opinionated about car seats because of this experience. I really like this car seat. It is easy to adjust and use.,5
Summer Infant Soothe and Vibe Portable Soother,"What a simple yet genius product!!!  My 5 month old used to scream in the car, or basically any time he wasn't being held.  I turned the vibration on and attached it to his car seat and suddenly he calmed down in the car!!  I'm talking every time!  Then he went through a phase where it was impossible to get him to calm down for naps, even in the Ergo (which had been working like a charm).  I put the vibration and lullaby on, stuck this bad boy in the front pocket of the Ergo (so it was vibrating agains his back) and he was out within minutes.  I'm obsessed with this product and take it everywhere we go!",5
BABYBJORN Little Potty - Red,"We used this for when we were out and about.  It was much easier to tote around than our other, bigger potty seat, but our daughter liked using it just as well.  It is very small and low to the ground, so I wouldn't want to use it as our main potty chair, but for taking to a friend's house or having in the car for an emergency, it was just the thing!",5
"Taggies Peek-A-Boo Blanket, Rubbina",This blanket is super soft and really well made.  I love it and my son loves it.  The only downfall is that you can not throw this in the washer.  It says to wipe with damp cloth.  Since this is made for a baby that is not a good thing.,4
Aden and Anais UpAwaySwddleBlnkts,This was listed on the Baby registry that the New Mom and New Dad requested.  They have not called with any complaints,5
"The First Years Jet Stroller, Red/Black","I love my stroller, it's light and easy and has small storage under neath. Perfect for small trips to stores or parks",5
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,"This pillow is not really what I expected.  I'm only 17 weeks so maybe I just have to wait until I'm a little further along to really get any benefit out of it.  The part on the top left of the pillow, where the seam is, gets SO tight and cuts into my neck which is super uncomfortable.  I'm a side sleeper anyway, so this really does me no good.  For now, it's in my closet.  Not worth the money I say, but to each their own.  Hopefully I'll be able to use it when my belly gets bigger.",2
3 Pack Snack Trap (colors may vary),"My 20 mo old daughter used it this morning for the first time. So far, it is working. No more spills. She even used that for her candies. The lid looks as if it can come off easily but even my ever curious daughter has not taken in off herself and it did not come off when the cup was dropped on the floor umpteen times.",4
New Mommy Advice Cards -24ct- Party Supplies,"These came in a package deal with some other games I purchased for a baby shower at the office. We are a promotional products company and sell pens, all kinds, and not one pen in our office would write on the slick shiny surface, so no one could give the new mommy advice on these cards.  It was a good thought, but a real bummer.  One person literally scratched the message and that was the only one she got.",1
North States Pressure Mount Diamond Mesh Wood Gate,Light weight wood on top of the wooden bars keep sliding over each other and the thing keeps coming undone on top of the metal &#34;U&#34; clasp doesn't clasp on top of the flimsiest piece of excuse of a baby gate EVER.Worst money ever spent on Amazon,1
"Summer Infant Snuzzler, Ivory","It does what it is suppose to do and is snuggly, but I don't use it often because what I purchased as far as car seat and stroller came with inserts already. I use this as a back.",4
"Graco Highback TurboBooster Car Seat, Spitfire",Quality of this product is OK .OK. but not excellent. But appearance wise it is so good. My kid is enjoying driving in this seat.,4
Safety 1st Magnetic Locking System Complete,"Works great, but I wish Safety 1st provided 2 magnet openers instead of just 1.Stil fits my needs and installed without a problem.",5
Totseat - Stripe in Blue,"What a great extra set of hands.  We go on a lot of trips and staying at a hotel with minimal space for baby, this has proven to be a real life saver.  Works on most chairs.  The fabric is rigid which keeps baby in place but sometimes not very comfortable.  Love the versatility and lightweightness of it.  Easy to clean, just pop it in the wash.  A little on the pricey side but worth every penny.",5
"Naturepedic Waterproof Flat Crib Pad, 28x52","The pad is great. When its needed, it makes a world of a difference. After one incident you will be thankful you have purchased this pad.",5
Sassy Bathtime Pals Squirt and Float Toys,"my baby of 12 months loves these toys. the bites, sucks and plays. I recomend these toys i think i'll use a lot",5
Carter's Safari Sky All Around Bumper,Nursery looks very cute. Bedding nicely made and attractive. Arrived as ordered in time for baby shower. recommend this set.,5
Lamaze Farm Truck Pull Toy,good toy.  My son did not play with it very much but being soft I did not have to worry about him getting hurt or damaging anything.,4
"Snuza Baby Monitor, Hero","I read a lot of reviews before purchasing this, We have not had any ""false"" alarms and so far has worked!  Gives us a peace of mind! Wish there were more products like this so many mothers worry every night! Only 4 stars because we have only had it one month!",4
Green Dragonfly Dreams Fabric Memory/Memo Photo Bulletin Board,"Yes, this item is rather small and a tad pricey. It is 14x14 which gives you room to fit about 5-7 4x6 photos on it. Despite the size and price I still love it. It's a nice soft green color and I didn't see any problem with them. I'm even considering getting another. What you see is what you get here. If you can deal with the small size then I would say go for it :) I ordered two and both of them got to me just fine :)",4
"Joovy Spoon Walker, Greenie","Sturdy, well built. I wanted something basic and nice looking. This is it. It stands out among the baby gear for being so clean looking.I let my litte sit in it and play with toys on the tray since she's still to short for it.",5
"Ulubulu Universal Pacifier Clip, Oliver Owl","Dissappointed with this pacifier holder. The clip is metal and pretty hard core. It takes some serious finger power to open the clamp, and it's quite scary, it looks like it could rip a hole/leave marks in my baby's clothing. It also won't clamp onto anything thick, so not on the car seat strap, or a jackets lapel, so not sure where to use this. The only benefit this holder has is that when the pacifier is falling I have more chance of catching it.",3
"Thermos FOOGO Phases Stainless Steel Straw Bottle, Pink/Purple, 10 Ounce",My two year old LOVES his new water bottle and asks for it many times a day.  It works great and seems to be easy to use.,5
Philips AVENT 4 Oz. BPA Free Bottles - 6 Pack,"We've used Avent bottles for both of our kids, and this 6 pack is just the thing for those up-every-three-hours nights with a newborn. Easy to use, easy to clean, and just the right size.",5

North States Supergate Classic Plastic Gate Mounts 5 Different Ways,"I am using this gate at the bottom of my stairwell and nobody seems to have a hard time either moving it or just stepping over it when needed. I am 5'2 and can get over just fine without having to take it down, it is sturdy enough to keep my one year old from knocking it down as well as not being able to climb over it. I like how it came with attachments to use as a swinging door but I am not using it this way. Overall it is a sturdy gate and has held up to a house full of rough housing boys so I give it 5 stars.",5
"BABYBJORN Spoon 2 Pack, Red/Blue",Our son holds the handle well but the spoon itself is a little wide for our 14-month old.,4
Jolly Jumper Bath Tub Toy Bag,The one I received was white - not blue like in the picture. Holds all the bathtub toys - dries them - doesn't lose suction. I'm happy with this product!,5
WubbaNub Brown Puppy,Wish I had gotten one sooner!  Baby loves it and is absolutely adorable holding onto his new puppy.  Also makes it much easier to keep up with pacifier.,5
"Baby Mucus Extractor, Nasal Aspirator From Dr. Natural Healing NasalCare. Patented Anti-backflow Valve, Doctor Designed","The aspirator works well but needs to come with directions since most aspirators don't have the valve system that this one does. Should the user close the vent valve or leave it open? How should it be turned? I have found that this aspirator works best when the user pumps the bulb rapidly, There should be clear directions since that's different from valueless aspirators--and there may be other differences I haven't found.",4
The First Years  Soothie Transition Bottle - 1 Pack,"The cup is good in that when using the nipple it's an easy transition to a cup with handles.  He'll drink out of the spout, which is more than I can say for the other sippy cups out there, but it leaks like a sieve.",3
Mobi TykeLight Portable GloMate,"My 3 year old son LOVES his ""Glow buddy"" which is the only good thing about this product.  We are currently on our 5th glo mate.  The glo mate works for a while (around 2 months) and then stops working.  I wouldnt keep buying this product, except my son needs it to go to sleep. I just found a similar product on Amazon called kinderglo. We are going to order one of these products and hope that these ""glow buddies"" work better!",2
See Me Smile Infant Mirror Tan Bear,"This is a great mirror with excellent visibility for your infant's rear-facing car seat  As other reviewers have said, it also has a very simple and effective attachment system, particularly if your seat has a headrest.However, you should note the obvious before buying it: the giant animal head will significantly reduce your visibility through your car's read window if you attach it in the center seat.  I drive a Prius which has fairly limited visibility through the rear window to start; with this monster installed on the center headrest, I can't see out the back very well at all.I'm strongly considering decapitating my dog-themed model, but I should probably think about the potential psychological impact that this might have on my infant first...",3
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,"This piece saved me unsurmountable time/effort. I was a breast pump mother--having to clean pump equipment/bottles every day. To boil water and """"cook"""" those items every time......UGH!This is a reasonably priced sterilizer--worth every penny.",5
"BRICA Seat Belt Adjuster, Gray",I am replacing an older seatbelt adjuster that was floppy and eventually wore out. This one is stiff and retains its shape. It is comfortable and slides easily when the seatbelt is being pulled through it. Just what I was hoping for. Great for adults as well as children.,5
Black and White Isabella Baby Changing Pad Cover by Sweet Jojo Designs,Very well made!!! It added that little axtra touch that the nursery needed. It washed up well and kept its shape.,5
Jolly Jumper Sneak A Peek Infant Car Seat Cover Pink,"This is exactly what I expected. It's very stretchy and fits over any car seat. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the window you peek in to view baby is only held shut by a tiny piece of velcro, where, if you meet a breeze, it opens on the sides :( Otherwise, it's very effective and I'm happy with the purchase.",4
"Lifefactory Glass Baby Bottle with Silicone Sleeve, Raspberry, 9 Ounce","I switched to glass bottles because once when I took a sip from my daughter's plastic straw cup, I could taste plastic. Ick! Glass has worked well, though a bit heavier to carry around. The rubber sleeve protects the bottle when it falls, so up to this point, no issues or concerns with the glass breaking. I plan on stocking up on small Lifefactory bottles for our new baby on the way.",5
"Stork Craft Aspen Combo Dresser Chest, Natural","Point of reference.  I've built loads of IKEA, Sauder, and other types of office furniture.The materials were packed in a way that protected the contents well.The pieces inside were NOT LABELED!  I was forced to identify the pieces by using the pictures.The screws that attach the back panel &#34;cardboard like&#34; were located so that they missed the desired locations and instead scrapped up the exposed areas on the right cabinet opening area.The cabinet has reasonable stability and survived being moved from the center of the room over to the space my wife wanted.  This things will serve as an acceptable piece of furniture for our infants room.If your budget and availability allows, I would recommend considering the Hemnes by Ikea.  We also own similar furniture styling for my wifes office, and while it was time consuming to assemble, I feel the quality of components and directions were substantially better.Thank you for checking out this review.",2
"Angel Dear Cuddle Twin Set, Brown Puppy","We have 2 of the brown owls for our now nearly 2 year old.  As soon as we saw them, we knew they would be the perfect lovey for our new baby and his woodland forest themed nursery. :)  I love having a spare when Mr. Owl needs to be washed or gets misplaced at nap/bedtime.  His grandma keeps one at her house too, so we are always prepared!  Easy to tuck in a diaper bag or suitcase, easy to cuddle with in bed.  We are expecting a baby girl now, and our only problem has been which sweet Angle Dear blanket to choose for her!  We highly recommend these super soft blankets.",5
Medela Tubing for Symphony and Lactina breast pumps #8007213 D (Old #8007194 /#8007179) 2 tubes - sold as a pair,"Not much to say.  Perfectly fit and replaced the manufacturers tubing.  Great fit, great suction.  Looks and performs just like the tubing that came with the pump.",5
Jeep Diaper and Wipes Case,I bought this to use as a litter bag in my new Jeep. I removed the plastic container that comes inside this. It will be ideal for stuffing with gum and candy wrappers as well as the occasional tissue between gas station trash bin visits. It can fit between the seat and the console or in the door storage compartments. Exactly what I was looking for!,5
Cloud B Tranquil Turtle - Aqua,"I have had the turtle for a little over a week and thus far it has been worth every penny.  I have a three year old that refuses to stay in bed and before the turtle he was up five or six times before he would go to sleep.  Every night was consumed dealing with bedtime.  Now he's up once or not at all and the only reason he gets up is if the turtle turns off and he still has not fallen asleep.  I personally think the product is somewhat strange looking on the ceiling and expensive when you consider the materials it is made out of, but the kid loves it and I have my evenings back!  I would buy one of these each month just for that alone.  I only wish I had found this sooner.",5
"Bumkins Disney Baby Wet Bag, Innie Icon",I use this for larger toys and even smaller loads of laundry. The bag itself can be washed and dried. It's got so many more uses that it's original intent. My toddler loves to play with it (know your audience before giving this to a child).  It was a great distraction on vacation since it had so many uses!,5
The Art of CureTM *SAFETY KNOTTED* Green Occlusion - Baltic Amber Baby Teething Necklace w/&quot;the Art of CureTM&quot; Jewelry Pouch (SHIPS AND SOLD IN USA),"I'll admit, I thought teething necklaces were silly.  My husband made fun of me and jokingly calls this necklace my son's ""witch doctor medicine.""  But my children are early teethers and when my son starting getting his first tooth before 4 months, I thought I'd give it a shot.  Both of my daughter's teeth erupting was accompanied by low-grade fevers, very messy diapers and LOTS of crying and fussiness.  After my son started wearing his necklace...nothing!  He now has 3 teeth and I didn't realize they were through until he chewed on my finger!  How does it work?  Knickernappies blog says:""In a nutshell, baltic amber (and this is only for amber from the Baltic Sea area) secretes succinic acid. This is a mild acid that is a natural pain reliever. Babies do not need to chew on or mouth baltic amber; it is effective when worn against the skin. As the amber is warmed by the skin's natural warmth, it secretes the acid, which is absorbed by the skin. Many pediatricians and dentists now recommend baltic amber necklaces as a natural teething pain reliever.""I'm a believer!  I recommend these to every new parent I meet.  I purchased the dark green round occlusion based on another reviewer's comments and I'm so glad I did.  I think the darker colors are more masculine than the golden amber (although it is hard to see any green in it at all--its mostly dark brown and grey and black).  I get a lot of compliments on it.  As for my son, he doesn't even notice it.  He doesn't play with it or pull on it at all.  It came in a sweet little bag that would be perfect for gifting and arrived very quickly.  I think the only con, for some, could be the price.  For me, the $20 was more than worth it for no teething pain!  And you need to be careful about buying the really cheap ones as they tend to be fakes with no medicinal properties.",5
Summer Infant Best View Handheld Color Video Monitor with 2.5&quot; Screen,"I have been using this video monitor in my toddler's room for over two weeks now and I absolutely love it!Every bad review written I would respectfully disagree with. There will only be interference with your Wi-Fi if you have an older router.In case this helps, I have a Cisco-Linksys WRT320N Dual-Band Wireless-N Gigabit Router. I can have the monitor right next to my laptop, cell phone, wii, satellite, etc. and nothing slows down.There is no weird blinking/flashing on the screen and the volume feature is not inconvenient at all!The pan and zoom are amazing and the quality is perfect for monitoring my toddler (who most of the time is climbing on furniture instead of sleeping, *this is why I purchased the monitor*). AND YES the night vision is black and white, color does NOT exist without light... basic science. I would definitely recommend this monitor to everyone and I have already told all my friends with small children about it! 5 stars all the way!",5
"BooginHead Pacifier Holder, Pink Polka Dot",You have to be careful when opening this because it squeezes your finger and pinches it. Once you &#34;learn&#34; how not to do that then it is fine.,3
"PRIMO Folding Potty with Handles, White granite","I love this portable potty seat!!!My arms tired of holding my 2 year old son so he won't fall into public toilets, and after an incident where one automatically flushed under him, I decided to get a portable, foldable potty seat for use while we are out and about.This is the first one I have tried (I studied them carefully, pros and cons)and I LOVE it for what it is. It folds up small, it supports my son well without fear of falling in, it does not pinch him at all (hinges are covered), it fits at the FRONT of the toilet seat, it's a great thing to have on hand. My son likes it because it's an ""exciting"" new thing to him. It has greatly reduced his fear of the auto-flush, and we have had no problems with it.",5
Bonaco Caboose Travel Potty - The Diaper Potty,"I'm a mom and potty coach and this is my must-get. The Diaper Potty is AMAZING, with or without Diapers. I am a cloth diaperer and only used disposables with this potty when on an airplane, etc.  Usually, it was used just to have a simple place to go while on the go! Extremely easy to work- many of the other travel potties have a learning curve. Extremely easy to clean. Extremely slim to pack- can fit into the laptop compartment of my backpack. The narrow middle is great for small tushies so they can relax on it and don't fall it. It also is low to the ground which is extremely ergonomical- producing a squat position to relieve constipation.",5
"Skip Hop Hare Brush and Comb Set, White/Orange","What a clever idea! & to top it off, it is well made. I am so happy with this purchase! I think this might be my new standard shower gift :)",5
The HERO Pocket Cloth Diaper (English Periwinkle) by Coqu&iacute; Baby,No leaks but I can't get it to fit here waist without it being too tight on her chunky thighs. It's a really cute diaper with a little frog in the back.,3
Teething Bling Donut Shaped Pendant Necklace (Jade),"Calms my kid down every time and keeps his drooly face off my jewelry!  I recommend one (or two) for every mama!  I get so many complements on it, no one knows that it is intended for my little one.  It makes an excellent baby shower gift.",5
"Safety 1st Alpha Omega Elite Convertible Car Seat, Lamont","Pros:I got this for half the price listed here, so for the category, it was well priced.Easy to put baby in seat.Harness straps adjust easily.VERY easy to adjust harness height (no pulling out belts and rethreading!)Soft and feels nice.Cons:Will only fit rear facing in a LARGE vehicle.  It's fine in our van, but it WILL NOT fit in a car.On the same note, it's also very wide.  Don't buy this if you need something compact.Very difficult to get the seat in tight using the latch system.  It took me and my husband tugging and pulling to get that belt tight for rear facing.RED FLAGS:This seat will not ever meet the manufacturers specifications for being level.  I've done a large pool noodle and it still wasn't even close.  It's still barely reclined in the most reclined position with the pool noodle under the front.  For my nearly 1 year old (20+ lbs) it is just barely within the level range for the completely upright position when it's in full recline.Overall, I cautiously like this seat.  He'll only be in it a year or so before I will switch him to his older sibling's forward facing seat (that I LOVE), so I'll deal with the level issues until then.  But if you have a small car, look elsewhere for a convertible seat.",3
"Evenflo Big Kid DLX Belt Positioning Booster Seat, Eclipse","My grandson loves this booster seat.  He has a back problem and is able to sit up straight in this seat.  Love the color since little kids spill on it, it won't show!  I would recommend this seat to everyone!",5
Yo Gabba Gabba Nap Mat,Not as pictured. This is the same mat featured by Amazon directly. Same print as the other Yo Gabba Gabba mats available when you do a search on Yo Gabba Gabba nap mat. I was looking for something thicker. I plan to return.,3
"Cevan Metro Vintage Biplane Premium Diaper Bag Coated Canvas, Brown Gloss","the bag looks very nice, is spacious, with lots of pockets and adjustable compartments. however, it is heavy, so if you plan to lug around a lot of stuff it ends up being quite cumbersome. also, the design on ours has started to come off and the bag scuffs. we have been using it for about a month.",3
C.R. Gibson Noah's Ark Nursery Loose Leaf Baby Memory Book,"My daughter is 3 and a half now and I got this book when I was only a few months pregnant...I love it.  This book has everything a parent would want to remember and pass onto their child/children when they are older.  And this price is outstanding!  I got it when it cost 40.00 (not including tax)...If you get this book, you will not regret it...",5
Susen Safe Shampoo Shower Bathing Protect Soft Cap Hat for Baby Children Kids (Blue),"This seemed like a great idea, and I REALLY wanted it to work since my son hates getting water in his eyes. For whatever reason he just hates it, rips it off instantly. So it just doesn't work at all for us, but the cheap price was worth giving it a shot, I'm sure it works for other parents. I'd also like to say even though it came from overseas the shipping was pretty quick.",3
Jeep Car Seat Travel Bag,"This isn't the most durable bag out there by any means. I would be surprised if it lasts more than a handful of flights, but for the cost that is fine with me. After my fist flight the bottom already has small tears in it. It still protects the carseat from all the dirty conditions of luggage transport. It is roomy enough to include extra stuff in the bag. The strap helps make it easier to carry.",4
"joovy Foocot Portable Child Cot, Orangie","We were choosing between this one and the significantly cheaperRegalo. This was the winner due to the other one having a few reviews complaining about a metal bar/rod in the middle and the quality not holding up. Not sure how much of that is true, but I'd rather have a good night sleep because my son is having a good night sleep. :)We've used it around 8 or 9 nights and it's held up well. My son moves at night, but it's stable and didn't collapse. He didn't complain a single time on this cot and although he's an easy kid, if there's something uncomfortable, we are sure to be told in a loud voice. Nothing wrong with this cot.Sure it's a bit more expensive, but it's turned out to be a good choice so far. Recommended!",5
"Bunnies by the Bay Blossom's Blossom Dress, Pink, 3-6 Months","I ordered 3 of these dresses, for baby gifts! Everytime I ordered it the price was cheaper! Wish I had waited until it got down to this price!! But, beautiful material, and darling dress!!  3-6 month size, bought at $10.75............",5
"Graco Pack 'n Play Playard, Ashford",Best purchase I've made. So easy to put together and put away and my daughter loves it. Perfect way to keep the little one busy and safe,5
BabyComfyNose Nasal Aspirator Crystal | #1 Tested Snot Sucker,It works!  Way better and more hygienic than that green bulb from the hospital.  Easy to use and easy to clean.,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",We bought this for our youngest and its great! It gives just a little light in her room for us when we check on her and give her something to look at as she falls asleep.,5
SugarBooger Buzz Jumbo Floor Splat Mat,"Love this!  I originally wanted the ABC print, but it was out of stock.  I'm glad I bought this one instead, because it doesn't stand out too much on our cork floor, but still looks cute.  Very easy to clean up, nice heavy weight, and a good size.  It will probably have a long life in our house - going from under the table mat to art project mat.  Would also make a cute kids' tablecloth.",5
"LA Baby 4 Sided Changing Pad 32&quot;, White","I think this is a great product.  Soft, but not too soft that she sinks in.  I like the curve it has too.",5
Dream On Me 3&quot; Foam Graco Pack 'n Play Mattress,"Fits my pack n play. Great way to add cushion to my pack n play. The mattress is firm which is what you should have for babies. To add a bit of softness, I also use this with a mattress pad - American Baby. Great combination.",4
Best Pal Barney the Dinosaur 12&quot; Plush Musical Singing Colorful World Doll,"This was a great buy since Barney items are so hard to find now.  It is good for the price and bonus , it sings too",4
"Razbaby RaZ-berry Teether, Red",I got the package in a very timely manner!  It was safely packed and just what I was wanting for  my 4 month old teething baby!,5
"Trend Lab CribWrap Fleece Rail Cover for Long Rail, Natural, Narrow",This does exactly as it's supposed to do: protect my baby from her crib and the crib from my baby.  It perfectly fits our standard-sized crib.,5
"Stephan Baby Satin-Lined Rosewood Keepsake Box with Silver Plated Birth Certificate Holder, First Tooth and First Curl Boxes",I ordered this item as a gift for a relative and the quality exceeded my expectations.  The holders are great quality and heavy for durability.  Beautiful presentation.  I am now ordering one for my child-to-be's treasure chest!,4
"Fisher-Price Kick and Play Piano Gym, Discover 'N Grow","I hesitated to buy this since we already had a playmat for our 2 month old and we were trying not to buy too much baby gear without reason. But I had heard good things and I had a gift card, so I went for it. I'm SO GLAD we got it. Our baby loves to kick and she will play in this for 20 minutes laughing and smiling the whole time! The toys are also lower than the ones in our play gym, so she can reach them and smack them around. I wish I had gotten this sooner!",5
White and Pastel Yellow Daisy Drawer Pull,"The knob was nice, not an exact match for the paint color of our furniture, but I can not hold that against the product, as there is no way for it to be a perfect match.  Whe I did not like was the size of this.  It is HUGE compared to the other knobs that I was replacing.  I ended up not using it.  it made the dressed look like it belonged in a cartoon or kids TV show.. not our babies bedroom.",3
"Dream On Me 2 in 1 Lightweight Folding Portable Stationary Side Crib, Cherry","Very nice looking,sturdy and easy to assemble. Color is quite rich in appearance. Small enough to place in guest room",5
"Razbaby RaZ-berry Teether, Red",She wasn't interested at first maybe because it is so big and my daughter was only four months when I gave it to her. Now she's almost five months and loves it,5
"Tiny Love Take-Along Arch, Sunny Stroll","It doesnt hold my son's attention, he just ends up pulling it down no matter how tight i fasten it. But i dont think its a problem with the product, I just think it was the wrong product for us.",3
Beaba Babycook Baby Food Maker,I love mine. I have just about worn it out.  The lid and bowl have started to not quite line up but still work beautifully and now I can have a steam facial at the same time. It makes small enough amounts that the food will not be stuck in the feezer for ever and will still be fresh.  I've even used it to steam small amonts for everyone's dinners instead of dragging out the big steamer.  My sitter has been using it for her child too and it still keeps pumping out great food.  As for those that say get a full size steamer then haul out your blender or masher or whatever- I dont have room.  My galley kitchen is the size of a coffin with not much storage or counter space.  I use my garage for a pantry (I love to cook and have just about every imaginable gaget- old and new) and don't want to go running up and down stairs everytime I want to cook for my daughter.  This little gadget has a home on my counter and is easily squished into my over stuffed cupboards when needed.  My daughter is now 15 mos old and am still using it and plan on continuing to use it till it breaks.  LOVE IT!!!!,5
"Similac SimplySmart Bottle, 4 Ounce","The bottle has a mixing spoon inside it that mixes the formula when you shake it. Brilliant.Doesn't leak, has a container in the cap for formula - this bottle is great.",5
"UPPAbaby Vista Bassinet Stand, White","If you're going to spend the money on an UppaBaby Vista stroller, you might as well purchase the bassinet stand.  The bassinet fits perfectly on the stand and allows us to keep the baby in our room at night or we can move the stand around the house while still keeping her in the bassinet.  I also like that I can continue to use the stand in the future as a hamper (need to purchase the linen insert, of course).  I love UppaBaby products and find that they offer versatility, flexibility and style.  Although they are pricey, you pay for what you get and I believe they sell a great product.  I haven't had to use their Customer Service yet, but I hear that it's a hassle free experience.",5
Graco Contempo Highchair in Graham,"I bought this as a gift for my daughter. She loved it, especially the height adjustment and the way it folds up and can be put out of the way when not in use.",5
Little Riding Hood's Reversible Soft Zebra Solid Pink Blanket with Ruffle,"It's really cute, shipping was excellent but a bit smaller than wat I expected its more for a doll baby then a real baby",4
"The First Years Spinning Drying Rack, White",Love the new bigger tabs on the ends of the bottle holders. Great upgrade from last one and feels more sturdy.,5
Columbia Baby Backpack With Ripstop Trim,"Both my husband and I love this bag.  It has a separate space that you can use for parent things as well as a nice big area for all of the baby things.  We haven't had to use the insulated side yet, as we're breastfeeding, but I like the idea that it's there for the future.  This bag is as nice or nicer than any other baby bag that I've seen.  Not to mention that it's stylish.",5
"Boon Flo Water Deflector and Protective Faucet Cover with Bubble Bath Dispenser,Green","This is a fun item for kids. As described easy for bubbles etc. I however have a small faucet so the item does not fit properly. But, it still works.",5
"The First Years Jet Stroller, Red/Black","I really like this stroller because it is very light and easy to fold and easy to push. It was easy to put together when it arrived. It has enough room for my child. What was very important to me was its 5- points harness, I know my baby is secure in the stroller and also, because she always tries to get out when in a 3 points harness system. The downsides are; the storage under the stroller was not very big, so cannot store bulker items. Also, the canopy/shade keeps falling forward getting into my baby's face, it has nothing that would secure it to prevent it from falling forward. In the end, I just had to remove the canopy because it was very annoying as it keeps falling forward. However, the pros of this stroller still outweighs the cons.",4
"The First Years Jet Stroller, Red/Black","Love the teal color of the stroller and that it is light weight. I wish it had a carrying strap, but they sell a universal stroller carrying strap here on Amazon and at Bed Bath & Beyond. I plan on purchasing one soon. I like the cup holder/storage area up top. The basket underneath is a little hard to get to but it works for an umbrella stroller.The only con I have with this product is that it does not really recline. It looks a little uncomfortable when my child falls asleep. Other than that the price was great and it maneuvers pretty well.",4
"Chicco NextFit Convertible Car Seat, Mystique","We have had this carseat for about two weeks now.  We are still very happy with our purchase!Likes: Installation takes about thirty seconds, the nine settings, the material the carseat is made of, it's not too wide or tall for the car, and it provides a comfy ride for our babyDislikes: Shoulder pads (we will be removing them) are pretty bulky and have a sticky/rough material against the baby's skinOur daughter is seven months old and for the last seven months has HATED riding in the car.  After purchasing this carseat, we went on our longest road trip (1.5 hours) and she actually FELL ASLEEP for part of it!  Overall, we're happy customers.",5
"Pearhead Wood Bank, Memorybox White","Perfect for holding keepsakes for baby.  We bought this for a memorial box for our deceased daughter.The foam stuff for the footprints did not take and hold the imprint, but we used inked footprints and that worked just as well.  It's a special and beautiful holding place for special things - the outfit she wore in the hospital, an unused preemie sized diaper, tiny booties, cards and letters from friends and family, and pictures and letters from our other children for their baby sister.  This was the perfect size to hold what we wanted to put in it, and is a special place for our family to help through the grieving process of our beloved daughter and sister...",5
"Mother's Lounge Carseat Canopy, Maddox","Winter or summer, this canopy is just right for new babies that need the close security feeling, without the smothering feeling of a blanket over the babies face. The Velcro is perfect to attach to the bar. I HIGHLY recommend it! Every mother with a new baby needs this!",5
"Summer Infant Lil' Luxuries Whirlpool Bubbling Spa and Shower Tub, Blue",Buy u are not regret ...,5
"Delta Children's Products Diamond 3 In 1 Crib, White","The good: It's a sturdy crib, and was easy to put together, with a little headscratching.The stickers on our crib were placed on the wrong parts, so we had to take it apart and re-do it.  One LARGE sticker was placed on the wrong side, so it is kind of ugly as it is on the outside of the crib.  Also, the pieces put together are not flush, so it looks poorly constructed if you look closely.  I guess that's what you get for the price-but it is sturdy enough for my son.",3
"The First Years 2 Pack 9 Ounce Insulated Sippy Cup, Disney Princess","I thought these cups were great when I first got them, but I absolutely hate the now.  Once the lids get dirty it's much impossible to clean them since the small rubbery plastic parts are glued in, the first time you forget to rinse them overnight they're shot.  We have soaked, boiled, used q-tips, etc maybe a toothpick would work, I haven't tried that yet. It would be nice if you could buy new lids for the cups because the cup itself is nice, but without the lids they're pretty useless.  I hope TFYs improves these cups.",1
"Playtex Toy Story Insulator Cup - 2 pack, Colors and Styles vary",My two year old son loves these cups.  They are pretty heavy duty and dishwasher safe on the top rack.  The &#34;sippy cup spout&#34; keeps him from spilling as he carries them around the house.  You really can't go wrong buying them.,5
Kidkusion Gummi Crib Rail,This is great! No more picking paint chips from my son's mouth; he has all of 8 teeth at 8 months and loves to practice using them on everything. It has held on well so far.,5
"Fisher-Price Cradle 'N Swing,  My Little Snugabunny","The dome light clips are flimsy plastic and broken on arrival.  Packaging was fine but materials very cheaply made. Amazon is expediting a replacement  which should arrive in time for the new grandchild.  Otherwise, we expect the product to live up to the excellent reviews which prompted my choice.  I will update if the replacement is not in the perfect condition expected.  Previous good  experience with the product still merits  the 4-star review but hopefully the corner-cutting will be more thoughtful.Amazon's customer service was excellent!",4
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"We are currently training our 2nd child.  With our first, we had 3 in diapers, giving us MAJOR motivation to get him potty trained, so we tried almost every seat out there.  Most of them were okay, but just got nasty quckly, were hard to disinfect, or were uncomfortable for my son.  The ones with the removable splash gaurd are not gentle and can scrape a child's sensitive parts.  Those were awful.  We were ""potty training"" for a full year before we finally saw the BabyBjorn potty chair in a local botique, and DS immediately sat in it.  He chose blue, and we took it home.  Within a week, he was trained, and began using the ""big boy seat"", so we saved the seat for our daughter.  It was incredable!  Now our 23 month old daughter is training.  We bought her this white babybjorn seat for our downstairs bathroom, with the blue upstairs.  She has been ""training"" for 6 days now, and is almost completely day trained!This seat is by far the best in our experiences.  Here's why:  1. the seat has a higher back and sides, which gives the child support while sitting down, standing up, or simply sitting there.  2. It is NOT easy to tip! several of the others we tried tipped without much effort when our child was putting pressure on the sides trying to sit down or stand.  3. It is super easy to clean - there aren't a bunch of seams to gather gunk, it's easy to wipe down with a clorox wipe and be done.  It's also super easy to take the little bucket out, and soak in clorox or hose down.  4. Kids can choose what color they want!  This was such a big deal to my children --- also, they are solid colors that can look nice with your bathroom.  The surface is also nice that your child can decorate the back with cute stickers if wanted.  5. It works for children of all different sizes!  My son was 40"" and 42lbs when potty training, and my daughter is 25lbs and a little shrimp, and this seat fit them both WONDERFULLY.Overall, having tried MANY seats, this one was the absolute best for both our children, and I would highly reccomend it to anyone in need of a seat for potty training success~!",5
Todays Mom Cozy Comfort Pregnancy Pillow - Sky Blue,"For $79.00 I thought this pillow would live up to it's title, &#34;Cozy Comfort.&#34;  This pillow is far from it.  The material is very low quality.  It is rough and scratchy and unfortunately unusable for me.  I attempted to return the item due to my complete dissatisfaction and what I believed to be false advertising.  They refused to refund me since this is a pillow.  I think a credit is the least the seller could offer.  It their policy in &#34;no refunds&#34; it should be very clear to the customer at the time of purchase, prior to check out.  As a customer I shouldn't have to go look for such product policies.  I will not order from this seller again.  :-(",1
"Kaboost Portable Chair Booster, Green","This is the best idea for a chair booster. It keeps the decoration clean, the kids feel they share the same furniture and it is amazingly well made. Fits well to the chair and does not get out, even when you move the chair around. I had bought one for my older daughter and just bought a new one to the younger. We love this booster.",5
"aden + anais 3 Pack Muslin Snap Bib, Jungle Jam","My DD is 5 months old and is a super drooler. So I wanted to buy a few bibs for her to catch her excessive drool. I love the Aden + Anais blankets so I thought I'd give the cotton snap bibs a try.The pros are:- They're super soft (just like their blankets) and get softer with each wash- Side button snap is a plus. Velcro closures pick up hair/link and wear out over time. These snap bibs are easy to take off/on and don't scratch my daughter's face.- Subtle colors and design. I like the soft colors and minimal design. I was looking for something that didn't have sayings like &#34;mommy loves me&#34; or &#34;daddy's little girl&#34;. These bibs are beautiful. I get compliments whenever my daughter wears them.- Oversized bibs. These are a nice, big size and provide ample coverage.Cons:- They're not absorbent enough! My daughter easily drools through several of these a day. As much as I love the look of these bibs, they just don't function as well as some of the other bibs that I've purchased (like the Carter's bibs). I was initially trying to avoid buying bibs with the plastic liners, I can see why people buy those now.These bibs would be best for light droolers or perhaps during the early feeding stages. If you have a moderate or heavy drooler, I'd recommend buying something more absorbent.",3
Tiny Love Clip and Go Musical Mobile,"I bought this when my son was about a month old (he is 7 mos. old now) and wish I'd discovered it sooner.  My baby is a very happy baby, but would sometimes get fussy/bored when shopping and running errands.  This was a life saver.  We were able to run around for hours.  Some notes after having used it for several months:- It has a couple of settings... you can have music and the mobile, or mute it and have just the mobile.  I wish it had an option for just the music and no mobile because we don't need to waste the batteries running the mobile after he falls asleep, but we still want the music to play.  That being said, the batteries last forever.  We used it a LOT and I only had to change the batteries twice.- I really like that the mobile blades are reversible.  It has mostly black and white images on one side for when they are younger, and it has little stuffed animals that dangle for when they are older.  There are velcro strips on the stuffed animal side to secure the stuffed animals when the blades are turned with the black and white side down, which is nice.  However, when you turn the blades so the stuffed animal side is down, the little animals swing around and they tend to get stuck on the velcro, which is pretty annoying.  You can fix this by buying some velcro strips and using the ""other side"" of the velcro strip to cover it, or you can just put a piece of tape over the velcro to keep the animals from sticking.- The mobile does rattle/vibrate a bit when you are in the car... there really isn't anything that can be done to alleviate that, as it does have moving parts.  It's not a fault in the product, just an observation.- Some reviews say the clip makes it hang down too far, and I totally agree... if you are using it on an infant car seat/carrier, you want to use the elastic band that velcros around the carrying handle of the carrier.  I believe the clip is meant for use on a stroller.I have recommended this product to many of my friends who are expecting, as it was a ""can't live without it"" purchase.  Two of my other ""can't live without it"" items are the Itzbeen Baby Care TimerItzbeen Baby Care Timer - Blue, and the Aden & Anais muslin blankets (which are fabulous if you live in a warm climate or have a summer baby)Aden + Anais 100% Cotton Muslin Swaddle Wrap, Jungle Jam, 4 Pack.",5

"Combi All in One Activity Walker, Pink","My 4mo old loves and I mean LOVES this bouncer/walker...he sits in it and plays with the horn, musical buttons, mirrors, and side bar soft rings. He gums the textured steering wheel sometimes too.  It rolls very easily across our hardwood floors so easily that he pushes himself around. I did notice it is much harder to maneuver on carpet but I think I read people had found a few solutions to that. I highly recommend this cool car and have actually had a few friends purchase the same item for their kids.",5

Puj Flyte - Compact Infant Bath (White),"As promised this tub folds and fits into a medium sized suitcase. I was delusional when I thought it might fit into a carry on suitcase. Nope! But it's still a great product. Our baby was 6lb 5oz when she was born (very small! as all the nurses kept pointing out to us). When we got her home at one week old and she had a bath the same day, to get all the hospital germs off her. Even though she was tiny it worked out really well.Now she is 12lb 5oz and still fits in the tub, over course now I keep the tap running very low to keep water in the tub since she displaces most of it when she in it. There is still plenty of water to wash her with. This is a tub for washing a baby not for playing in.We put the 'travel' portion of the tub to the test when we did a road trip to see the grandparents. It fitted into a medium sized suitcase perfectly! Made it very convenient to bath her during the trip.Love this product!",5

Maybe it is the different membranes (they are slightly different) or the fact that the pump tubing connects into the top of the device circle instead of the bottom??? Even though the name brand is more expensive I would spend the extra few dollars to get them.,2

Baby likes that he can actually sit at the table next to me while I study or eat, not just in a high chair next to the table. If I want to use it like a traditional high-chair I still can though. Just snap on the tray and use it on its own.",5

I bought them for my granddaughter to wear for an Easter egg hunt our family was taking her to.They looked so cute on her with the lamb outfit she had and they kept her little legs so warm in this early Spring weather.I wouldn't hesitate recommending this item for any little girl.  They're too cute for words.,5

The color of the wood is beautiful and matches other items I have purchased for the same room.  We purchased a mattress prior to buying this crib and were pleasantly surprised that it fit perfectly.  Other reviews stated that the mattress (if purchased elsewhere/different manufacturer) may not fit properly, but we had no problems.  Baby has arrived, and is sleeping well in this well-made crib.  I would definitely recommend this crib to others interested in purchasing it.",5

"Fisher-Price Rainforest Friends Musical Mobile, Signature Style","Fisher Price often makes baby products that are almost but not quite perfect.  For example, for us, for this item...the mobile is motorized but how come it's not illuminated?  All in all, a fine product though.  Baby likes to look at the mobile and the addition of the night light is always welcome.  Product design lends itself to developing your child as the ""petals"" and animal plushes help the baby associate (at least in my opinion).  And the included dome style mirror facilitates additional visual stimulation.",4
Dena Happi Tree 8 Piece Crib Bedding Set,We chose the Dena Happi Tree Crib Set because it was feminine and had cute pastel colored forest animals.

Dr. Brown's Formula Mixing Pitcher,"We use Gerber Soothe which is crazy hard to mix and my forearms are screaming from shaking bottles like mad.  My husband found this for me and it works great.  My forearms are slowly recovering.  It mixes the Gerber Soothe great, even when the water is a little cold.  Just have a few complaints...I haven't been able to make 32 oz without making a mess.  No matter how gentle I am, formula comes shooting out the top, even in the locked position.  30 oz is the real max.The measurement markings on the sides are difficult to read.  Black text, like most bottles would be better.The handle at the top easily falls off.  I understand it comes off for cleaning, but why can't it snap on? Such an annoyance.A great product overall.  But if you need to mix more than 30 oz at one time, consider getting a bigger pitcher.",4
"Baby Einstein Musical Motion Activity Jumper, Blue","The jumper was  relatively easy to assemble.  Our eight month old grandson immediately started reaching for the interesting, colorful attachments, and doing some bouncing.I like that the legs are adjustable:  getting taller with his longer legs, thus lasting for many months.  I like that he will have a safelace to play, especially when his parents are distracted with household chores, etc.I don't like that the bouncer and my grandson and hisnparents live 120 miles away. . . . .",5
Wizard Convertible Car Seat with LATCH in Midnight Print,"We bought this seat from the Babies ""R"" Us store local to us.Here's my thoughts.  The head restraint are a great concept, but the positioning is wrong relative to the shoulder harness.  The headrest and the shoulder harness straps entry point into the seat back are interconnected in one moveable piece.  That may be somewhat confusing if you have not seen this seat in person, but the portion of the seat back that the headrest is attached to is also the same peice that the shoulder straps enter into the seat through.  This peice is movable,up and down, in order to properly adjust the shoulder harness.  The harness should go over the shoulders and straight into the seat back, not over the shoulders and down at any appreciable angle.  The reason for this is that the force in a collision (from the front) will compress the spine of the child as they are forced forward if the harness is entering the seat too far below the shoulders in the back.  The problem is that when the shoulder harness is properly adjusted the headrest is too high up relative to the childs head.  When I have the harness properly adjusted to our daughter, the bottom edge of the headrest is at about the mid to top of her ear and most of the headrest is extending above her head.  This is likely why I have seen posts about this seat complaining about the childs head getting stuck under the headrest when they fell asleep.  This problem is unfortunately built into the seat and not user fixable.The other shortcoming of the seat is the position of the shoulder harness tightening strap.  It exits the seat between the childs legs and is reachable by the child when strapped in unless the shoulder straps are tightened to the point that the child has no mobility whatsoever.  So while in motion (driving along) you find that the child has reached down, grabbed the strap and loosened their shoulder harness.  Very dangerous!  I fixed this problem by doing some hand sewing to the little flap that is velcro'ed over the strap.  By stitching the cover down at each corner, our daughter can no longer raise the strap at a sharp enough angle to release the latch, but we can still get our finger under the cover from the front in order to release the strap.The seat is also too sparsly padded.All things considered, I would still rather have my child in a seat with a head restraint system that one without, and this is the only one on the market that I am aware of.  But it needs work and the strap issue must be addressed immediatly by the buyer so that your child does not loosen their own shoulder harness.",3

"Lambs &amp; Ivy BFF 5 Piece Bedding Set, Snoopy","Everything looked so perfect and will certainly make the nursery look coordinated. We also purchased the wall decors, the mobile and the lamp and the extra blanket and everything goes together perfectly. Definitely works as a gender neutral room as well which I love!The only thing that could be better is if the set came with a sheet. It has a fitted sheet, but when the child is old enough to use the comforter, having a flat sheet would be nice.",4
KidCo Magnet Lock Starter Set,These are pretty amazing. Super simple to install. The adhesive has been sufficient so far for us (and our 9mo old). Our custom cabinets have an extra nipple on the rubber dot that keeps the door from hitting wood against wood so we just have to press in each time we want to lock or unlock - but not a problem at all. A big hit in our house.,5
"Bright Starts Comfort and Harmony Portable Swing, Florabella","My daughter is turning one next week, and we have gotten a lot of use out of the swing. More so when she has been congested (to help keep her head elevated). Its very quiet and does not burn through batteries. We have been very happy with this swing its been easy to pack up and take to grandma's house if needed. And we did not want to own a big swing along with a travel swing, so this one has been perfect for us.",5
"ERGObaby Options Baby Carrier, Black","My baby is 10 months and he weights approximatly 24 lbs. I bought this carrier because from all the reviews it was said it was such a great buy. However they never mentioned how big their child was. I originally had the moby wrap and my baby was getting too big for me to carry him with that and I needed more support and when I bought the Ergo baby there was a difference with how the baby's weight is distributed around hip and shoulders. Overall I can see this carrier is much better than what I had before, the reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 stars is because I have back pains after carrying baby for 30 mins. Maybe I'm not used to it. I am 5'2 and 125 lbs :) hope this helps. Also my baby never slept on the moby wrap and with this carrier he takes a good 20-30 mins nap.",4

Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,We absolutely love these bottles.  We have tried several different brands.  Avent by far was the best for us.

"Playtex Diaper Genie Elite Diaper Disposal Pail, White","My daughter is expecting her third child, and was so excited that we would replace this item for her. She had one before, and she and her husband absolutely loved it. The one drawback, I suppose, is quite minor: ""I guess there really *is* limit to ho many dirty diapers you can stuff in there, even if you're a tough Coast Guard dad."" The last Diaper Genie, alas, gave way under the tidal pressure of too-tough Daddy.With new resolve to empty the container when it's full by any reasonable human standard (and acknowledging that Coast Guard Dad is likely to give 120% to everything he does), my daughter and her family can't wait to have their Diaper Genie back. I'm taking it to them when I go visit for the new baby's birth.Why they love it? ""Simple, Mom: It does what it says it does. Really. Read the box.""",5

Fisher-Price Rainforest Melodies and Lights Deluxe Gym,"My father bought this for my son for Christmas. He is now 5 months old, using it since 1 month. A few of the things I really like about it are that he can play with the hanging toys or flip onto his tummy and play with the ribbons on the sun, zebra tail, and crinkly leaf. Until he was big enough to reach the toys(around 2 1/2 months, if I recall correctly), the lights just amazed him. You can move toys around with the loops, or even add your own like I did. The music and lights really entertain him for probably the first 10 minutes, then its mostly the lights he likes. Lights also slow down when you put it on the rainforest noises, which is nice because it allows him to fall to sleep. The reason I gave this product four stars instead of five is: while the music is nice, it is very, very repetitive and I wish there were more options. The mat is thin, so if you have hard floors you may want to fold a blanket under it for extra padding. I don't have an issue with it on my carpet. Also, this is not the easiest to take with you, as you have to take apart the arches to get it flat, and its a little more of a pain to do than i would like. Overall its a wonderful product, and well worth the money that was spent on it.",5

"Baby Aspen My Little Night Owl Snuggle Sack and Cap, 0-6 Months","This is an adorable Halloween costume-ish/baby dress up outfit. I received it as a baby shower present and thought it was pretty big when I saw it in person. I figured it would be too big for my baby until much past Halloween, closer to the 4/5 month range.Imagine my surprise when I tried to put the hat on him at 6 weeks old and it was already too small! I was only barely able to squeeze it on top of his head for a few photo ops. Granted, he probably has a big noggin, but still, it's a little disappointing that the main ""owl"" piece of the outfit would be so small when the age range is given as 0-6 months.The sleep sack itself is already  bit snug too, in my little one's case. I'd put him at about 10 lbs at 6 weeks, so he's a little chunky, but not absurdly so. I still love the outfit, I just wish I had tried it on him earlier so I could have gotten more use out of it. Just a warning for anyone that buys this, don't assume because it looks huge, that it is too big for your baby.",4
WallStickersUSA Super Mario Game Nintendo Wall Sticker and Decal,"I didn't know what to expect after reading some of the other reviews, but decided to take a chance anyway. They were super easy to apply ( my son enjoyed being able to decorate his own walls). They also look good with the paint on his walls, I thought that would be a problem since they're shown with white walls only. I would buy again, it's the first thing that people notice when they walk into his room (they love them -- the expression on his face PRICELESS!)",5

The Diaper Clutch Diaper and Wipe Case - Tropical,"It is a little expensive for what you get. This is basically a pretty wallet for diapers and wipes.

"The Rockabye Glider Serenity Glider, Micro Chocolate brown","I love this glider. It is exactly what I was looking for. I wanted a glider that could transition from the nursery to another room in my house. This chair is identical to the Rosie Glider sold at a very popular brick and mortar baby store. But is a lot cheaper here. I have not had any issues with squeaking or noise. Glides smoothly but does not swivel (fine with me). The chair comes fully assembled in a very large box. All you have to do is get it out of the box and have someone to help you lift it. I chose the Micro Beige and am happy with the color and the fabric. The directions say to spot clean with soap and water. I'll see how that goes. For the price and convenience, I could not be happier with this purchase.",5

UPPAbaby Plum VISTA Stroller,"I guess what most people look for in a review are the cons, so I'll start there.  This stroller is huge, making it less than ideal if you are looking to put it in the trunk of a car.  Sometimes I catch the rear wheels on stuff--but they are what give it a great smooth ride. They are also solid instead of inflatable, which means no maintainence.It folds pretty compactly if you take the seat off, but it isn't necessary.  The seat is reversible giving you the option of being able to see your baby while pushing it.It would also be nice if it included a cup holder or child's tray.  I purchased a Baby Jogger cup holder and installed it--which is a bit of a pain.  The pockets inside of the basket hold drinks fine, but it would still be nice not to have to bend over.Everything is removable, which is usually great, but sometimes my wheels come off when folding it.  It only takes 1 second to put them on, but I fear really losing one when gate checking it at the airport.It is supposed to be easy to fold, but this took me a while to actually figure out.  It is very simple once you understand it, but I'm impatient and didn't read the instructions.Some great things.  I love, love, love that the bassinet is included.  However, you probably won't get too much use out of it if you use it for your baby, I think it's supposed to be used until they are 15 lbs.  I however, never follow these rules and put both my 6 month old and 2 yo in it together.  The older one just sits with his legs straight out and the baby sits between them.  I also have the optional footboard that my 5 year old stands on.  I can push the Vista with all 3 kids in/on it with minimal effort.  If it's just the baby, its really easy to steer and push one handed.  Seriously, its the best ride of any stroller I've tried (and I've owned at least 7 or 8).The colors are great, although a little more subdued in person.  It was really hard to find a purple stroller, so it made me so happy to find the Vista.  Unfortunately, it's been discontinued in the 2009 lineup.The adjustable height handle is a lifesaver.  No more stooping over again.  Everything is washable, which is great for the mattress cover in the bassinet, since my baby tends to be leaky.  It also reverses from a breathable side to a warmer microfiber/sueded side, which would probably be nice in a cooler climate (not for this FL gal).And best of all, it just plain looks cool.  It's a head turner of a stroller and who doesn't love being envied?  Unless of course, some steals it, which is always on my mind when we are at Disney.So if you have a place for a larger, sturdy stroller with a super easy ride, this is a fantastic choice and one you don't see every mom in town pushing.",4
"Toddler Size Waterproof Bib w/Flip Pocket, 2 Pack, Green Robot","Love these bibs, nice large size, and very cute. only thing I didn't really like was the neck part fits too big, Velcro should adjust for smaller necks",5
Disney Pooh Large Diaper Bag - Pink,This bag was just as I thought it would be!!!It is very roomy and holds all the stuff I need and more for a day out with my baby girl!!!,5
Cloud B Tranquil Turtle - Aqua,"This toy is amazing!!! i got it for my older sister (20 years old) because she loves the ocean and has a hard time falling to sleep. SHE LOVES IT! Then i thought it was cool so i bought one for myself (i'm 18) and took it to college with me, now my roommate is begging me to get her one and my boyfriend always want me to bring it over so he can borrow it! It really has not age limit! the sounds are calming and the light are AWESOME! I highly recommend this product!",5
Kids Line Winnie the Pooh Together Time 4 Piece Crib Bedding Set,"Received product fast and easy. This was a gift, and it was exactly what she wanted for the nursery. Great quality and pricing. Overall a 5 star seller.",5
"Pura Kiki Stainless Infant Bottle Stainless Steel with Natural Vent Nipple, 5 Ounce, Spring Green, 0-6 Months+","Our 2 month old loves these bottles. Really well designed, simple to use and most importantly, completely non-toxic and safe. Wish I had found these earlier.",5
"Safety 1st Complete Air Protect 65 Convertible Car Seat, Great Lakes","Unfortunately, I did not spend the time to research customer reviews on this seat as much as I did just the safety aspect before I bought it.  There wasn't time, as at 4 months old, my son already weighed 22 pounds, so he was quickly approaching the 25 pound weight limit so I needed to act fast.  We have a 2012 Outback, and it is VERY difficult to get this seat forward facing in the middle of the back seat without it being wobbly, and the Outback is ""the"" car for families.  Also, (and to me, the biggest factor), this gosh darned seat is VERY hard where my son's tushie goes.  I didn't even bother to push down on it for the longest time, and when I did, I felt SO bad!  No wonder he's hated sitting in it.  He's been in the 100th percentile for height and weight since he was a couple months old (weighed 27 pounds by his 8 month checkup!).  He's now 20 months old and after doing TONS of research, we just bought a Recaro Pro Sport and LUCKY ME--for some reason, the color Envy has been discontinued so I got it for a STEAL!  I cannot believe how much more solid it is than this chincy Safety 1st seat.  I mean hey--it's a RECARO seat--the company that makes seats for professional race car drivers and the airline industry for pete's sake! As a side note, I'm 100 pounds soaking wet.  I was able to fit my buns into the safety 1st seat and it is VERY uncomfortable.  Yes, I realize that the pressure to the foam is greater because I'm 2 1/2 times my sons weight, but it really felt like there was NO padding whatsoever.  I'm so happy I went with a Recaro on my new purchase--and the feel of it---like the Ferrari of car seats in every way.  Do NOT waste your money on this seat.  Invest in one that is safe AS WELL AS comfortable!!!",2
Kidco Adhesive Mount Magnet Lock 2 Starter Sets,"I live in a rental, and my hubby didn't want to use the screw on cabinet locks when our daughter started crawling. I have these on the cabinets under our sinks and they work great most of the time, but sometimes, no matter how I use the key, it will not unlock. I'm not sure if this is because of the type of cabinets we have (not a flat surface on the outside) or the placement of the locks.The adhesive is really strong, so before you place it, be sure that you have it EXACTLY where you want it - otherwise you're hosed, because it's REALLY difficult to remove... in fact, I haven't been able to yet!",4
"Tiny Love Take-Along Arch, Sunny Stroll","This is a must-have item. The only reason I was not going to give it 5 stars is because of the deceiving product name. When I purchased it, it had a ""musical"" element in the title, which looks like is not the case now. So, I'll go ahead with 5 stars. This is so versatile- it can be stretched across a crib, pack 'n play, swing, high chair, etc. We use it everyday across our daughter's car seat. The toys are great and she loves to play with them. However, they do come unvelcroed a little too easy and sometimes we ""lose"" the butterfly attachment because baby has pulled it off to play with. Overall, great toy! Well worth the money.",5
"CoCaLo Jacana Removable Wall Appliques, Orchid/Yellow/Lavender/Brown","I bought these a year and a half ago...we put them up, and the next day we found a few on the ground. I figured ok, its just a few. But by the time my baby was born, 3 months later, half of them had fallen down and i kept putting them back but within a day or two they were on the floor again.  My house is not humid, the walls are clean, and we never put them up and moved them around...they were falling from the first application.  I bought 5 sets and each one was the same.  i ended up just taking the few left off about 7 months after the purchase and replaced with ones I found at target.",1
Safety 1st Heavenly Dreams White Crib Mattress,"We received this mattress as a gift for our baby shower (it was on our registry). At first I didn't notice the 2"" gap on the lengthwise side of our crib (Graco Lauren 4-in-1). We had purchased the AngelCare monitor and I spent a full 2 hours trying to figure out why the monitor was showing movement when nothing was in the crib! I moved it all around the room away from the wall, window, etc. and still movement. I finally removed our crib bumper and found the HUGE gap! I rolled up a large beach towel and stuffed it in there for the moment being but I am so frustrated! After measuring my crib (52"" in length) I measured the mattress as well. It is printed on the tag that finished length is 52"", but it only measures 50""! I measured it multiple times to check. Also, this mattress bends like no other when I put sheets on. They are standard size sheets. The mattress literally bows when I put it on. I didn't think much about it until I read another review saying theirs did the same thing.We have not purchased another mattress yet, as I am in the market now, but I would definitely NOT recommend this one. Great value, but not great results.",1
Bearington Baby - Blessings Lullaby,I bought three of these lambs as a keepsake for 3 of my grandhcildren who sang Jesus Loves me for their Great-grandma's funeral.  They sang like little angels.  They keep this on their beds to play when they go to sleep at night.  They were tenderly kind to my Mother.  This made a lovely keepsake.,5
"Peg Perego Primo Viaggio SIP 30/30, Cacao","great neutral colored car seat. It is a bit heavy, but I knew that going into my purchase. Sometimes it is hard to remove the carseat from the base that is strapped into the car. Other than that it is great. Straps and buckles are super easy to deal with.",4
"2 Tubing for Medela Pump in Style and New Pump in Style Advanced Breast Pump - BPA Free, Steam Heat Tolerant; Replacement for Medela Part # 87212, 8007156, 8007212; Made by Maymom (One Pack)",I bought these to replace my old ones and they worked perfectly. A great replacement item for my pump .,5
"Moby Wrap Organic 100% Cotton Baby Carrier, Coconut","I was desprite to find something that I could use safely and still have my baby close to me. My child has severe acid reflux to the point he would choke frequently and it was scary to me to think I couldn't get to him fast enough. With this product I could get my housework completed, play and interact with my 3 year old, and still have my son with me @ all times. After you get use to the different positions and how to wrap your infant, it is wonderful. My son loves it. He sleeps in it with ease. It must remind him of being in my belly. I would recommend this product to anyone that has a infant or is going to have one. AWESOME PRODUCT!!",5
"timi &amp; leslie Rachel 7-Piece Diaper Bag Set, Black","I ordered about 8 diaper bags to compare (bed rest, thank goodness for Amazon Prime) and this one was my favorite by far. I cloth diaper, and it's large enough to fit everything I need. I love that it has a little mommy purse, and I love all the extras that come with it. I am a little worried that the straps might hurt my shoulder when it's full, because it is a little heavy empty, but none of the other reviewers have mentioned that, so I think it'll be ok. The &#34;vegan leather&#34; looks real and is thick and expensive looking. I'm hoping it doesn't flake, because as we all know, diaper bags get serious wear and tear. Will update in a few months as to the condition of the outside and of the bag. Tons of pockets inside and a few on the outside, so it's good in that department. In the end, it came down to this bag and Timi & Leslie's Kate bag. I adore the Kate bag too, but it's very classy and dressy, and this one is a little more retro and much more me =)",5
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,"This review is for Playtex Advanced Standard gift set:Pros:1.  Works with Ameda breast pump; although, not very comfortable to hold since curved bottle.2.  No need to use extra little brush to wash the parts.  I have enjoyed using Dr. Brown bottles, but needed bottles that do not need extra holes to be washed especially when I am away from home.Cons in my situation1.  I do not like that they are not straight bottles.  Easy to tip over when milk is stored in the fridge.2.  The numbers are labeled in color, unlike Dr. Brown bottles which are marked in plastic itself.  i am not sure how many washings it will take before the numbers start to disappear.2.  If you want to make 8 oz of formulated milk in the 9 oz bottle, you will have NOT have enough space to put 8 oz of water and then add 4 scoops of dry powder.Overall, good bottles.  Although, I have heard that weil baby bottles are really nice.  Have not tried those yet.",3
Safety 1st Finger Pinch Guard,"I have a set of double doors going into the media room. The door monkey won't work on those. This foam piece s perfect. The doors won't shut, no pinched fingers.",4
Infant Optics DXR-8 Pan/Tilt/Zoom 3.5&quot; Video Baby Monitor With Interchangeable Optical Lens,Very easy to use in any lighting conditions. The pan tilt function is good for bigger rooms that have multiple spots you need to monitor. Audio sensitivity is excellent and the range covers our 2-floor house. The zoom on this monitor beats all the monitors since it uses an optical lens piece to zoom the camera sight.,5
BRICA Deluxe Kick Mats (2 pack),"works great in the car, but the mini van has already busted a bottom strap off.  Adjustable everything makes it great, but maybe not for stow-n-go-thick seats.",3
Born Free BPA-Free Twister Bottle Brush Set,"I use wide mouth Dr. Brown bottles, 6 per day. This cleaned great at first but soon the spongey part separated from the plastic clamp. I tried to fix it but the problem seems to be that the sponge is too delicate to stand up to daily use. I am now have the same issue with the nipple brush..the sponge is tearing and getting loose. I would expect that eventually..but not week one of use.",1
"OsoCozy 6 Pack Prefolds Unbleached Cloth Diapers, Size 1",These hold up fantastic in the wash. be advised:  they do shrink a small amount in the first initial washes to prep before use.,4
"Eddie Bauer XRS 65 Infant Car Seat, Archive","My husband and I share a Toyota Camry, so when we started looking for a convertible carseat, we were really concerned with it taking over the backseat (and forcing us to scoot the front seats way up).  We definitely didn't have that problem with this carseat!  It installs easy (and my husband has had to take it out and re-install it a few times when he needs the extra space).  Our son is so much more comfortable in this carseat because it does have a lot of padding.  The headrest raises up, so we'll be able to use this as our son gets taller!",5
Maclaren Stroller Wheel Bag Cover (Techno XT/XLR),"This wheel cover is for my Maclaren Techno XLR stroller, which I absolutely love. The bag is cheap considering it is Maclaren and it is easy to put on and take off. It is much better than trying to use a shopping bag, towel, etc. to protect the hood from getting dirty. However, like others have said, you kind of have to touch the wheels to get it on and off. I wish they made a wheel cover bag for the bottom wheels too.",5
"NoJo Coral Fleece Sheet Savers - Blue, Pack of 2","Lifting a mattress out of a crib to take off the sheet, put another one on, then place the mattress back in the crib is a hassle. Being able to keep baby's crib sheet clean another day with the sheet saver keeps that whole ordeal at bay.1) Great material: waterproof bottom, soft fleece top2) Discretely ties to the crib bars under the crib bumper3) Washes and dries in a normal cycle with like colors with no special treatmentMust have!!!",5
"Summer Infant Deluxe Piddle Pad, Black","First day I put it in the seat, my daughter had one small accident and her whole seat was SOAKED! Very disappointed!",2
Summer Infant Day and Night Handheld Color Video Monitor with 1.8&quot; Screen - Silver,"We bought this monitor because we needed a second camera and at the price it was half off of the reg. price.  We didn't know what to expect but the box had already been opened, but everything had still had the original twist ties on it.  The camera works great and that is why we really bought it. The monitor seems like it was dropped because there is a black line that goes up and down the screen. The picture is much clearer then our other one but this one easily gets interference with our cell phones and wi-fi signals.  We love the video monitor and are glad we got it for the price we did, otherwise we would of sent it back. Now if only the seller had mentioned why it was being sold at this price, we probably would have spent more money on another one.",4
"Boppy Pillow with Luxe Slipcover, Monkey",I already have a &#34;my Brest friend&#34; pillow and it is 10 times better. This pillow did not stay in place an did not support the baby as well a the MBF. It does have a nice soft fabric though,2
Evenflo Snugli Comfort Vent Carrier,"We were celebrating our daughters second birthday, which happen to also fall on mothers day and we were going to Sea World. Well I know strollers are a pain in some attractions so we decided to by this for our 7 month old son. Oh my gosh he loved it, he even fell asleep in it. It is really comfy I carried him around for awhile and I was 4 months pregnant at the time and it didnt bother me one bit. Now we use it for our ""new"" son and he loves it. We dont push the double stroller around anymore, if we head to the mall baby Chris gets to ride with mommy and daddy gets the stroller for Michael. I wish I would of bought this for baby #1 and not baby #3. I always thought this things were kinda silly looking but boy do I take back those words.",5
"Philips AVENT BPA Free Natural Polypropylene Bottle, 9 Ounce, 1 Pack","These bottles come with the #2 (Slow Flow) nipple. Our 4-months-old is breastfed and supplemented with formula. The nipple shape and flow is just right for him. I would stay at this flow level (Slow Flow) as long as I'm breastfeeding him because it's pretty close to the flow when breastfeeding.These bottles are wider than some of the other brands out there so packing and storing these bottles require more space than the average bottle. Just to give you an idea of the width, you can only fit 5 Avent Natural Flow nipples in the Munchkin Deluxe Dishwasher basket which could hold 10 of the standard brand nipples.My baby prefers these bottles over the numerous other brands we've tried so I recommend these bottles for babies that are both breastfeeding and formula feeding.",5
"Chicco KeyFit 30 Infant Car Seat, Midori",Loved this carseat! Baby loved this carseat! Loved that it had a bigger weight/height range than other infant seats. It is heavy though. Which can be a bummer.,5
"BreathableBaby Breathable Mesh Crib Liner, White",Exactly as described - easy and works perfect for our daughter. They are a nice pretty purple just liek the picture.,5
Kidkusion Gummi Crib Rail,This didn't even stick after 24 hours of application. Ended up in the trash. Don't waste your money on this.,1
"Vital Baby Toddler Straw Cup, Orange, 10 Ounce","I love these cups.  They haven't leaked on us once and they have stood up to my 15 month old throwing these numerous times on our hard tile floor, concrete, etc.  My daughter has been using these since she was 13 months old and never had a problem sucking the water out of them.  I always make sure the the vents in the valves are fully open before we use new cups though.  Sometimes the slits aren't fully cut which would make it hard to get the liquid out.  These are also super easy to clean and the perfect size to fit in cup holders and diaper bags.  Sometimes liquid gets trapped in between the top cover and the screw on lid so you just have to pop off the top cover where the mouth piece cover is attached to and clean it out.  The mouth piece cover is super convenient too!  These are by far my favorite cups.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Despite all theses pretty reviews, I wish I could know why my son didn't like it!! I bought 2 of them. The first when he was 5 months old and I thought I might introduced it early. Later, and because my neighbor girl kept biting it when she came and they refused to take it, my wife cleaned it in the dishwasher :( Then, I had to get him a new one when he was 8 months old. Unfortunately, he didn't like either. So, I quite.",2
Summer Infant Turtle Digital Temp Tester,"I recieved this as a baby shower gift 2 years ago. The turtle is a constant companion for all our bath time adventures. And after 2 years of use, it is STILL WORKING. I have had NO problem with the battery or the button. I have other family/friends who have bought this same item after seeing how well it works for my son's bathtime. They haven't complained about theirs either. I do not know why other people online have complained about this turtle thermometer.*Update march 2014*This thermometer is still working since I started using it in the summer of 2009!!!  And with the original battery it came with!!!  My kids have learned not to enter the bath tub water if the there's blinking light color is yellow (too cool) or red (too hot).  They patiently wait for the light to show green before entering the tub to the perfect temperature!",5

"JJ Cole Bundleme Shearling Baby Hat, 0 - 6 Months","My baby has an average sized head and at 7 months this hat is pretty large on her.  I have to check on it from time to time or it sinks down over her eyes.  It's very cute though, and keeps her head warm.",4
"AllerZip Waterproof Bed Bug Proof Zippered Bedding Encasement, King DEEP Size (Fits 11 - 18 in. H)","The mattress cover works fine. It was a little confusing how it goes on at first but once we figured it out, it went on easily. Fits well. Isn't noisy or crinkly.",4
"Regalo Extra Wide 58 Inch WideSpan Walk Through Safety Gate, White",ive searched everywhere for a gate that would fit my 59&#34; hallway opening and this is the only gate i found for a reasonable price despite the reviews i gave it a try and i was suprised that its not that bad at all.. the only reason why i gave it 4 out of 5 stars is cause it does bow out a lil bit  and even though it could be made a lil sturdier my 2yr old son shakes it all the time and its held up pretty well. overall good gate,4
Born Free Stage 3 Silicone Nipples- Twin Pack,I switched from using Avent bottles to the Born Free bottles when my daughter was just a few months old. She took to them without a hitch and has been using them when she's not nursing ever since!,5
Safety 1st 2 Pack Custom Fit All Purpose Strap,"perfect for protecting our our bearded dragon from our 18month old.. kinda bulky though, not sleek or fashionable in any way",5
Mobi TykeLight Portable GloMate,My Mobi just stopped working. I'm hoping I can figure out a way to get the manufacturer to replace it. Other than it breaking right away i was loving the product.,2
"Fisher-Price Cradle 'N Swing,  My Little Snugabunny","Our 3 month old daughter loves this swing ! It works like a charm to get her to sleep especially during the day.The music stops after 15-20 min - while this is ok, I wish it came with a remote control to restart the music if the baby starts to wake up.The plush material is polyester and the top part is not removable.  My daughter's skin is very sensitive so I have had to place a cotton receiving blanket on top of the cushion.Wish there were additional rotating objects in different colors - the swing comes with light pastel birds",4
Planet Wise Large Roll Down Wet Bag - Funky Flowers,"I am enjoying this wetbag, if one can enjoy such an object.  I bought it for traveling and it works great for daycare, so everything soiled (clothes, diapers, cloth wipes) goes in & there's no stuffing needed to make everything fit.  If I could approximate its size, I'd say it is similar to a king-sized pillowcase.The rolldown isn't as helpful as I expected, but maybe it's because the bag zips closed so well, that I haven't needed to roll down the top to contain odor or wetness.  The pattern is as pretty on the fabric as it is in the picture and I like that the loop keeps it attached to the diaper bag.",5
Sassy Terry Teethers 2Pk,I bought these for my 8 month old daughter to use while she was teething.  I wet half of the watermelon one and put it in the freezer and gave it to her when she was teething.  She REALLY liked it.  She can hold the non-frozen part and chomp on the other end.  She's even used the grape one dry without freezing it.  It was also nice to have around when she fell and bumped her mouth on a plastic ball.  Her lip started swelling up and this took the swelling right now while also distracting her.,5
Munchkin Sprout Drying Rack,"I think I summed it all up in the title of this review. I like that it spins easily and doesn't take up much space. We live in a super small apartment with a super small kitchen that is severely lacking in counter space, but I manage to have room for this. It does hold a lot of stuff, including large (even really wide) glass bottles and the pieces of my breast pump. I like that it also has plenty of room on the bottom for things that won't slide onto the arms like flat bottle lids and one piece of my pump that just can't be dried that way. I also like how it collects the water instead of having to drain into the sink. Another feature that I get a lot of use out of is the cup in the middle. I use it to store my bottle brush. I use the Phillips Avent bottle brush, so it isn't like a normal one and I don't know if it would work as well with a normal one, but I think it would. (don't bother with a normal one though anyway.. just get the Phillips Avent bottle brush.. its cleaner and works better. :))",5
Active Latch Natural Feeding Nipples - Slow Flow (2 Pack),"This was the first nipple I tried, and after experimenting with many others I came back to this one. It is simple to use and I can really see my LO has to work to get the milk out, just like when breastfeeding.As a point of reference on how slow the flow is - you can turn the bottle upside-down and no milk will drip out.",5
"Nuby 2-Pack 10 oz No-Spill Cup with Flexi Straw, Colors May Vary",I bought this cup for my daughter who is 21 months old.  The straw can be detached from the cap and she quickly learned that can jam her finger in the which causes the liquid to spill and make a huge mess.  It is very poorly designed.  These types of products should be toddler tested before they are put on the market.,2
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Jumperoo,"My baby girl does not want to give this thing up, even though she's growing out of it. She has beefy little legs from bouncing in here all the time. I bought it because of it's pretty ocean themed look, and she loves all the toys and sounds it makes. Sturdy and heavy.",5
"Chicco DJ Baby Walker, Sea Dreams","I went back and forth on whether to get a walker.  I read the reviews, the admonishments, all the negative warnings about using a walker but I kept going back to the simple fact... I used a walker as a baby and I know how to walk just fine.  So I first purchased a different, low-tech BRU walker.  He loved it but, as a longer baby was already too tall for it at 6 months (he was 27"" then).  We problem solved with this DJ Baby Walker.  He's 31+"" now and there is still room to raise the walker if we need to.  I have had 4 months of blissed daily-use from the walker.  My son relentlessly chases the dogs. Can stop and turn on a dime.  He love to ram into the vaccumm (I suspect it is his nemesis) - and the best part is the walker doesn't go up any changes in floor levels so he can zoom around the living room, dianing room and hallway, but cannot get into the kitchen, bathroom or bedrooms.  It honestly is such a great design for that.  And, whats more, it isn't just a toy but a crash-course for parents in  childproofing... with a buffer (great for those first time parents who have no idea what little hands can do) -  because of the size of the play tray - he reaches for but cannot grab most things... It has been great for him and us alike.  So if it delays walking by a few weeks... I can live with that.  It has been worth the months of giggles and joy.",5
"North States Supergate Easy Close Metal Gate, White","I do not use this as a baby gate, so I can't speak to that specific application. I do have a granddaughter that is at my house frequently, and they keep her contained as well, but I primarily use these gates to keep my dogs out of the carpeted areas of my house and to keep the two that don't like each other separated.  They work great--easy, one hand opening and they swing closed behind you. There is a hold open feature if you push it just a bit beyond 90 degrees. It also locks securely with just a twist of the latch.  When I bought this gate initially, it was only because the one I thought I wanted was not available. I have another gate that I bought from Amazon that I thought I really liked, but it doesn't have the auto-close or hold-open features that this gate has. Eventually I will replace that gate with another one of these.Bulldogs are very determined, but they can not get through this gate. The tension system is very solid, but when you remove the gate it does not leave any marks on the wall. I have a newer house, so I wanted something that would look nice and wouldn't leave any permanent marks. It suits my needs perfectly and I have recommended it to several people.  By the way, my 15 month old granddaughter can not open these gates, even when they're not in the locked position, because you have to lift up slightly--which is easy for a 5-6 ft tall adult, but difficult if not impossible for a small child.",5
BABYBJORN Original Carrier - City Black,"I have a baby with colic and walking her around in it is the only thing that seems to work. At first it was a hassle getting her in and out of it, but now I use it daily and have gotten the hang of it. I am still not able to take the carrier off without slightly waking her up but I am hoping that will come in time. The other thing is that I have to sit down to put the baby in it, and I havent figured out how to do it standing up with great ease. In terms of comfort and support, although my baby is only 10 lbs, I go on 3 mile walks with her in it and I have no back problems, occaisionally my shoulders get a little uncomfortable.The carrier being black and padded does get pretty warm in the sun and sometimes my baby gets a little sweaty in it. Overall, I would recommend this, especially if you find that you will be needing a carrier pretty often.",4

"Trend Lab Dr. Seuss Wall Clock, ABC",This clock was great when it first arrived.  It looked fantastic on the wall and was true to the story book.  However after less than a year the hands stopped turning.  The second hand just jumps in place and won't move around anymore therefore the other hands don't move either.  For the amount of money this clock costs it should last years!  The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because it looks great but what's the point when it doesn't actually tell time?!,2

"Britax Pioneer 70 Harness-2-Booster Car Seat, Kiwi","My son is 3 & 1/2 and I just didn't feel comfortable having him in a regular booster.  The harness system gives the security I wanted plus the bonus with this booster is the recline so when he does nod off, his head is not bobbling forward.  I should have bought sooner, installation was a breeze fits great in a Ford escape & our Toyota Rav.",5
bumGenius Freetime All-In-One One-Size Snap Closure Cloth Diaper - White,We originally bought some alva baby diapers but after some serious leakage we bought a few of these.

Safety 1st Sound 'n Lights Activity Walker,"My 6 month old is about 2"" from reaching the floor on the lowest height adjustment - this product definitely needs to advertise a minimum height rather than saying ""for 4 months and older"".

*SPECIAL PROMOTION*The Art of CureTM *SAFETY KNOTTED* Honey - Certified Baltic Amber Baby Teething Necklace w/The Art of CureTM Jewelry Pouch (SHIPS AND SOLD IN USA),Before using this necklace my daughter was constantly drooling and looking for anything to chew on. After one day of having it wrapped around her ankle she calmed down and the drooling is only on occasion now. She seems much happier since we started using it.  She is only 5 months so we keep it wrapped around her ankle under pajama's or socks and slippers so she can't get at it. We hardly ever need to use the teething tablets now and haven't used Tylenol even once since we got the necklace.  It's worth it!!,5
"Kiddy World Plus Convertible Car Seat, Lavendar","This is by far the best seat we have purchased.  We have bought a few.  This one allows our son to have freedom of movement and also gives him a place to lay his head down when he falls asleep.  He loves it and he is 2.No cup holder, which is a negative.",5
Bugs On Board,"My son was born 4-3-05, and he has been enjoying these bugs for a few weeks. At first I just held them in front of him, and he would track them with his eyes. Now I have them attached to his carseat handle. He likes to look at them and he also likes to bat them, or punch them when he is mad, hee hee. The bright colors and bold patterns catch baby's attention.",5
"Peg-Perego Pliko Mini Stroller, Aloe","I recently purchased this stroller in neon and I'm very impressed with it! The colors are adorable! We recently took it to a family reunion, and received many compliments! Fit great in the trunk with all our other bags, playpen, etc. that we needed for a whole weekend. Our baby loves sitting in this stroller, it's nicely padded and comfortable, she can see everything that's going on, and even napped in it!  It is very easy to put together, it took under 10 minutes. Sturdy construction. Folds and unfolds easily. Be sure that after you've unfolded the stroller it's all the way clicked into place! It's easy, just be safe and double check! You won't be fitting a diaper bag in the storage basket, but there's plenty room for all the baby essentials. I have hung our diaper bag on the handles, and the stroller is definitely strong enough to hold it without tipping. This stroller maneuvers easily though tight restaurants and stores, and does great in grass. I love the canopy! It is bigger than most umbrella strollers. The harness is great to use, and getting baby in and out is quick and easy. A naughty toddler would have to press very hard on the button to get out of the harness, that is not a concern. I am a taller parent so I really appreciate the height adjustable handles. The included water bottle holder is also very appreciated :-) I was very apprehensive about spending this much on a compact stroller, but I'm so glad I did! I know that this stroller will last through a few kids. So nice to know we won't be trying to get a new one after each child has gone through it. I would recommend this to every parent shopping around for a new stroller!",5
"Megaseat Play and Snack Tray, White",Loved it and so does my son just wish the top and leg snapped together better other than that it's great,4
Fisher-Price Coco Sorbet Soothing Motions Glider,"My sister let me borrow this for my child...my first and only child. She has slept in this every night, and she's now 3 months old.  The battery life reads &#34;3 hours.&#34; I had this thing moving all night long, for almost 2 full weeks before I had to even think it was slowing down. If it were really 3 hours, I wouldn't find this worth it. Recently, the motor seemed to not work correctly, and it's barely moving anymore...but I feel this is my fault...due to how I might have carried it when I moved it quickly at one point.  The chair moves 360 degrees, and often I'll turn her around when I'm getting ready in the morning, so she can see me, and know where I am. I didn't use the music until the last month, when she finally decided she didn't want it so quiet during sleep.  I'm buying another one via Amazon due to the great price and free shipping with PRIME. The closest store to me, otherwise, is 60+ miles away. I love this, and hope she still wants to be in it for several more months, and then I'll hand mine down to some new nieces and nephews. I think everyone has to find what works for their baby, and this definitely worked for my girl. :)",5
Sassy Snap and Squirt Sea Creatures,"I loved this product at first. Bright colors, nice shapes, great in & out of the tub.HOWEVER, and this is very important, even with proper care water can easily get trapped, causing mold & mildew to grow inside the toy.This is the worst part, YOU CAN'T SEE THE MOLD UNTIL IT'S TOO LATE. Several posters mentioned seeing mold squirt out and rings around the edges, well, mine aren't that bad yet. My first clue was dark spots showing through the orange crab. Several of the other toys are darker colored and you wouldn't be able to see this. You're going to be squirting clear, mold infected water long before there is so much mold you can see it squirting out.I considered purchasing these again and just disinfecting them once a week and replacing them every so often because they are inexpensive, however since you can't tell there is mold growing in the toys until there is a ton of it, I'm searching for something new. I'm considering the Sassy Stay Clean Silly Squirts.",1
"MAM Training Cup with Handles, 6 Months, 8 Ounce , Pink","My daughter has reflux and I was told by her pediatrician that I should give her rice cereal to help keep her food down. With her regular Avent bottles, it seem like it's hard for her to drink the milk. Someone I know gave me the idea of giving a 4 month old a sippy cup, so I decided to try out the cup I bought. I LOVED it, she really did well. It is a fast stream nipple but my daughter can handle it. And she was gripping the handles all by herself. :) As far as the leaks go, you need to make sure that you pull the handle up more toward where you screw on the top. If the handle is loose it will leak. It's a great purchase.",5
"Chicco DJ Baby Walker, Splash",I was worried about getting a walker because I knew they were seen as dangerous.  But after reading up...the main problem is that babies fall down stairs in them.  I don't have stairs so no fear there.  There are also issues with babies hips and learning to walk eventually.  I just make sure he's not in it everyday and he's not in it all day.  It's nice to have though for those times he needs to be a little contained for his safety.  He flys in it.  He does like to crash in to everything (on purpose and not) so make sure you're prepared for that.  We first had it when we had carpets which they don't really move on but now we have all tile.  I figure if you don't have stairs and you're a good parent and don't think a toy babysits your kid then it's great.,5
"Brica Baby In-Sight Mirror, Gray","I bought this mirror for my husband's car because he doesn't have headrests on the back seat. It fit perfectly on this bench seat and we never had problems with it falling or moving. So, we bought two more for our babies when we purchased our GMC Yukon. Our Yukon has a middle bench seat with two headrests but they're smaller than normal seat headrests. I didn't think it'd be an issue, but the strap system is not designed for smaller headrests. We have it tightened as much as possible and it's still loose and will fall and move all over. So we have water bottles shoved in the extra space to keep the mirrors tight. They work great now.",3
"Bright Starts Comfort and Harmony Portable Swing, Florabella",The swing is very nice and great bargain for the money. The music is very nice and the ability to adjust the recline is a great feature.,5
"Ikea's ANTILOP Highchair with safety belt, white, silver color","iam not sure why the seller has this listed for almost $80.00! that is a rip off. i live 30 miles from ikea and i own this very same high chair also can be ordered from ikea.com guess the price? 19.99! yes you see that right it is only a 20.00 high chair being sold on here for this insane price. b4 you waste a whole lot of money for nothing it is def a great chair my daughter loves hers. she is a yr old been, in it since 4 months old. but i would never never never pay the price listed! the chair is easy to clean its light yet not easy to tip bc of the wide spread legs. mine has the tray as well. not sure why its not pictured . but i hope this review helps and if you paid this much for it well...... now ya know and i would ask for a refund... man what people do to make a buck geeze.",3
"Luvable Friends Flannel Fitted Crib Sheet, Yellow Circle","I ordered the sheet for my two-year-old. He likes the car design and softness. Some flannels feel a bit rough to the touch. Although after one wash, the sheet already has a hole.",3
Summer Infant Contoured Changing Pad Amazon Frustration Free Packaging,"We purchased this before my daughter was born to be used on her changing table. It wipes clean easily, the raised sides help keep baby from trying to roll while you change her and its light weight so its easy to move. The only bummer is my daughter is getting tall enough that her feet hang off the end now (very tall little one) so we may have to retire it soon.",5

Mamas &amp; Papas Baby Snug Activity Tray,"I could easily give this product 5 stars if it just stayed on. I tried slightly wetting the suction cups and that helped a little bit, but baby still was able to rip it off. Nonetheless, she still got tons of entertainment out of it.The chair itself definitely gets 5 stars from me. We used it as an infant seat, a high chair, and a bath seat for when she outgrew her infant tub.  It's attractive and compact.",3

"Summer Infant SwaddleMe Organic Adjustable Infant Wrap, Ivory, Large","We have owned five of the ""regular"" cotton swaddles, and they work great! We had to replace them after about two months of use because they shrank and the velcro started to wear down. I bought one of these because I read that it has a bit more stretch to it, and it most definitely does. My son is about 17 pounds now and this will fit him for another couple of months (he just LOVES to be swaddled). This will fit him longer than the non-organic swaddles. So far, after about ten washes, it's held up well. If your baby is on the larger side, this is a great option!",5
"The First Years 2 Pack GumDrop Newborn Pacifier, Blue/Green","We didn't use a pacifier initially as it is not recommended right away when breastfeeding.  When we did, we initially used the First Years Soothies pacifiers as they were recommended for their nipple shape.  However, this pacifier had an odd circular shape that came too close to her nose and was also rather heavy and would just pop out.  Saw an ad for the gumdrop pacifier made by the same company with the same nipple shape but a nice nose cut out.  Daughter is still not very keen on pacifiers but this one she will use and it does not cover her nose or pop out.  She won't use any other type of pacifier!",4

Diaper Dekor Plus Refills 2 Pack,"I have a Diaper Dekor Plus bin. I'm using it for 14 months. I need but refills regularly. These product fitted perfectly to my Diaper Dekor Plus bin. I used to use regular 2 pack one (box used have blue color, this one is somewhat white).i'm not sure about the &#34;Biodegradable&#34; thing... what i noticed is, it smells a lot then previous (with diapers). Was it suppose to protect from that smell or not, i'm not sure.",3
Lite-on-Shoulder Baby Sling,I purchased this sling for my then 4 month old son to use when traveling & doing quick errands. Traveling thru the airport & on the plane this sling was a lifesaver! I was traveling alone & so hauling an infant & carry on bags was a lot easier with him in the sling. And on the plane I kept him snuggled up in the sling & so he was quite cozy & comfortable & he was able to sleep thru the whole flight! I also like how I can throw the sling in my diaper bag or purse in case I need it & not have to drag the stroller out. I originally had the baby Bjorn which is nice too but it was rather bulky & my chubby little guy grew out of it rather quickly. Definitely happy with my sling!,5
Lamaze Spin &amp; Explore Garden Gym,"If they made one of these things for adults, I'd get one!!  My daughter LOVES this thing.  It's got that crinkle-sounding paper that babies seem to love, and spins really easily. The colors are really bright and everything is easily accessable for little arms and hands.  I have already told my pregnant friends that they need to get one of these!",5

"Summer Infant 3D lite Convenience Stroller, Black","Disclosure: I was given a few product to review however my opinion is my ownI love this stroller I knew I would love it as soon as I opened the box! Very way to unfold, maneuver and pushes very easily! I love the way the seat reclines all the way back! I would've liked to see the seat have a little more padding but my two year old doesn't seem to mind! The storage compartment at the bottom is very roomy which is wonderful since I have two diaper bags to carry! The canopy is larger than expected and has high handles I'm not very tall only 5 ft 5 but its a plus not having to bend over to push it! My daughter sits very comfortably in it and never fights to get out which is unusual! I love this stroller and highly recommend it!",5
Baby In Sight Mirror,This is my absolute favorite item!  It is so great to be able to glance in the rear view mirror and see what my little guy is doing!  Is he awake?  Sleeping?  Fussing?  I can tell in just a second.  It's also great because he can entertain himself just by watching himself in the mirror!,5
BRICA Bath Kneeler,I love the quality. I have not used it yet but I'm  sure I will love it when I give a bath my little boy.,5
Cosmos &reg; Small Size Dark Brown Table Edge Soft Guard with 4 Corners with Cosmos Fastening Strap,This was a good product but my son discovered it at 1 year and ripped it off the entertainment center so..... just judge it based on your childs personality.  Mine destroys everything.  It was great until that point though,3

"Bright Starts Bounce Baby Activity Zone, Neutral","Ordered this because my neighbors grandson has one and loves it, so I decided to order one for my granddaughter.  It arrived very quickly, however it was not what I ordered, it did have the giraffe, the spin tiger and the sunflower and the mirror, but NO push button musical tray as specified...To say the least this would have been my granddaughters favorite.I didn't send it back because my son and his wife and my granddaughter live in a different city that is very far away, so when I saw how my granddaughter was already enjoying this bounce baby,I decided to have them keep it.  However, make sure that you get what you have ordered, as there are several different types of this bounce baby.",4

"Kalencom On the Go Potty, Blue","I carried this to India since my son started potty training just before we left. Wound up using it with relatives who didn't have conventional Western toilets and restaurants that had toilets that weren't kept clean. This is definitely going in the trunk of my car for any future emergencies. The travel bag it comes with isn't anything to write home about, but it afforded a clean way to carry and store the potty and some refills, along with a few diapers and a travel pack of wipes.",4
Munchkin Click Lock 7-Ounce Weighted Straw Flexi Cup (Green),"These cups are good for babies that begin to use cups early.  My little guy was an early walker at 8 months, so this cup was perfect he could drink from it at any angle.  We only use it for water, so I will warn it does leak a little, but no problem for us.",5

Yookidoo Stack 'N' Spray Tub Fountain,"My son got this for his 1st birthday, and he loved it.  But after a few uses, it stopped working.  I thought it was the batteries, so I changed them out, making sure the cover was screwed on as tightly as possible.  Still didn't work.  I cleaned the contacts in the battery compartment, and it worked again, but only if you held the buttom down constantly.  It had no more on/off functionality.  Then it stopped working completely 2 days later.  I am really disappointed.  I would send it back to the company, but there's no contact info on the website.  Very poor design.",1

Graco Contempo Highchair-Melbourne,"PROS:1. This chair is very stable.2. Entire seat is washable. I throw mine in the washer.3. Folds flat in a snap for those with small kitchens or multiple chairs.Cons:1. Hard to reassemble the seat after wash.2. At around 15 mo. my daughter figured out how to take the inner tray out (and fling it).3. At age 2 she could buckle and unbuckle herself making it quite unsafe to leave her unattended even for a minute.4. Few month later now she has figured out how to use the lower bar and foot rest as steps to climb up.5. She is two years four months now she is able to remove the main tray by pressing the latch.Bottomline:My child has eaten almost every meal in this chair. Except for a little phase she went through when she did not like sitting in it she enjoys it as well. Thus making it the most useful baby gear  we purchased. My child is an average size child and i have been quite surprised with her ability to do the above mentioned things.Overall, it is still a good chair and we still use it as she is not ready to sit at a table yet. I believe if Graco  can make this a toddler proof chair it would be a superb product.",3
Brilliant Beginnings Gift Set,"My 3 mo. Old is enjoying all the toys, speacially the caterpillar. She can hold on to it easily and the colors help attract her attention a lot!",5
"Ju-Ju-Be Paci Pod Pacifier Holder, Lilac Lace","Great pacifier case! Sturdy yet flexible. Doesn't make much noise when bumped into something because it's fabric, not rigid plastic.",5
The First Years Night and Day Bottle Warmer System,"I liked this product until I heated a bottle for my son, then tested the milk first and found that it was hot enough to burn me.  Granted, I was making a 2 oz. bottle, which is all my son would drink at first, but there is no way to change the temperature for a bottle that is not 4 or 8 oz.  No matter the size, it takes several minutes to heat a bottle, which was way too long for my screaming baby in the middle of the night.  It was faster to run a bottle under warm water or to mix a new one using powdered formula and room temperature water.  I found this product to be mostly useless.",2
"PRIMO Folding Potty with Handles, White granite","This potty is perfect for taking to stores, restaurants, anywhere outside the home.  I have a sturdier potty seat for the house (it also has handles).  When we go out, my 2 1/2 year old does really well on this seat.  It doesn't slide at all, as long as you follow instructions and place it at the front of the toilet seat.  The handles are what makes this seat better than most of the others out there.  Kids aren't aware of germs as much as we are and my daughter will touch pretty much anything unless I make it clear that she can't.  She knows to ""only touch the handles"" when sitting on this seat and so everything goes without a hitch.  Also, I carry a small diaper bag which is no bigger than a medium purse, and this fits inside it easily.",5
Arm's Reach Mini Co-Sleeper Bassinet,"We bought one of these, and have had one for both of our kids. Our babies ended up sleeping in our bed but these were still nice as a place to put stuff or to lay the baby. I know a lot of people arent comfortable sleeping with their babies so this is a great compromise.",5
"Munchkin Arm and Hammer Nursery Fresheners, 5 Pack, Lavender or Citrus",pretty good and took out the diaper oder - could use something to stick to instead of just sitting there,4
"Badger Basket Envee Baby High Chair with Playtable Conversion, Orange/Blue","This productive is cute and made of durable plastic.  I chose it because it's multifunctional, changing from a high chair into a separate chair and desk. Babies outgrow a lot of the things purchased for them and I wanted something that would grow, so to speak, with my baby! Great product at a great price. It took a no time to receive and 15 minutes to pt together.",5
Kids' Sling Bookshelf with Storage Bins - Natural Natural,"My nearly 16-month-old daughter LOVES flipping through the pages of colorful board books, and this sling bookshelf allows her to see and reach what book she wants to flip through. It's great that the slings are differing depths to allow for shorter or taller books. The storage bins are great for toys, too. Pretty easy to assemple and looks nice enough that we put it in our great room.",5

"Chicco Capri Lightweight Stroller, Tangerine","We purchased this stroller for use as an umbrella stroller instead of buying the super cheap ones. We like the Chicco brand. It is very smooth and we like the added features of the sun shade and the goodie basket. I will agree with other users that sometimes my husband kicks the rear wheels and the strap between the child's legs should be longer. However this fits our needs perfectly. We wanted something small, compact, light for our 2 year old in malls and other brief trips. It is very compact and light weight. If you want a full on stroller that has an adjustable handles, cup holders, all terrain wheels I highly recommend the Chicco Cortina Travel System. We loved ours and still use it for the zoo or the fair.",4

Exergen Temporal Artery Thermometer MODEL# TAT-2000C,"I recently purchased the Temporal Artery Thermometer mostly for my 3 year old grand daughter.  We've only practiced with it on adults.  Its a little tricky getting used to it, but once you've practiced, it appears to be fairly accurate and quick.  It should not present a problem applying it to the child's forehead, its that quick.  It is very similar to the one used by her pediatrician.  I decided to buy through Amazon for two reasons.  1.  Ease of the transaction and 2.  Price, I used some points I built up on my card.  The seller had a good reputation and with the points and free shipping, it was less expensive than the next lowest price I found which was on Ebay.  I cannot comment on durability or Mfg. support as I have only had it for a few weeks.",5
Little Partners Learning Tower - Natural,"As the other reviewers have noted, the Learning Tower is very sturdy, and it is nice to be able to involve my little one in meal prep.  The other day, I had her wash potatos while I peeled them, and she watched as I mashed them and even gave them a stir.  That was the first time she every ate mashed potatoes.However, I really think they need to rethink the design of those ""optional"" legs. We have tripped on them so many times and it hurts.  Also if my daughter climbs down using one of the side with the ladder and then turns 45 degrees to walk away, she trips over the legs and falls on her face.  She did it a few times.  I thought she would get use to it and learn to go around them.  After the last trip, I noticed her limping so we decided to take them off.  The legs also make it harder and heavier to move around.  The good news is that it is just as stable without them, but it makes me feel as though we paid for extra wood.As useful as this is, it has safety issues including the big holes that children could fall though as others have mentioned.  I don't really find this thing to be any better than pulling a chair up to the counter and letting her stand on that.  A handy carpenter would probably find this to be a waste of money, and could make something similar and safer.  I hope we get more use out of it for puppets, the easel etc as my daughter gets older.",3
Jeep Universal Cruiser Car Seat Carrier,"I was looking for a universal stroller base like this one because I use public transit and needed a light weight option. This fit the bill perfectly. My safety first car seat fits just fine, the ride is nice and smooth and the storage underneath it roomy. It would be nice if there was a carry strap or a dedicated carry handle for transport from and to car or bus. Otherwise I love it.",4

Kawaii Baby Ultra Soft Cross Over One Size Pocket Cloth Diaper with 2 Large Microfiber Inserts in Bright Yellow,"While I sympathize with the other reviewer, having lost 2 pregnancies, one at 5 months and one at 6 months. I don't think it's fair to ask a company to lose money. They refunded the product.The diapers are phenomenal. We have had previous experience with bum genius, bummis easy fit (the best diapers made, but at 3-4 times the cost) and a few other brands. These diapers are just as good as any other snap diapers out there. I still can't believe how affordable they are. I recommend them to anyone who doesn't want to pay the money to get the bummis.",5
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Rainforest","I bought this booster set as a high chair in my little dinner room. It works great for us. Although it's portable, we never use it outside of our house. My little one didn't enjoy the toys every often. I believe the babies get bored with the toys in front of them very quickly. So I would say the toys are quite useless but the seat is really good.",5
"Infantino Explore and Store Gym, Jungle Buddy","I needed another play gym to bring to my office where I am able to bring my baby:). This one is amazing, it folds up easily for storage and captivates my sons attention with the black and white activity bar",5
"Moby Wrap Original 100% Cotton Baby Carrier, Red","I got the Moby wrap with my first son and found it frustrating to wrap the first couple of times. Once I got the hang of it I LOVED IT! Carrying both my first and second son in the Moby was way easier on my back and shoulders then the other traditional baby carriers. It was also easy to shift the baby to nurse without even taking him out of the wrap. I liked it because the baby was securely inside the wrap both at the newborn stage and later when he wanted to be out ""seeing things"". With the more traditional front packs I had (Baby B. etc) I found that the baby seemed to flop a lot more then when he was in my Moby wrap. I used it hiking, shopping, in the yard and around the house. I would recommend this wrap to any new parent and think it is one of the ""must haves"" for a new baby.",5

My daughter loves them.",5
"Babiators Unisex-Baby Infant Ops Junior Sunglasses, Black, Small",My baby loves it!! style is unique and very  light product. IF YOU have a baby I recommended babiator sunglass.,5
"The Rockabye Glider Sunny Recliner, Micro Tan","So far we are liking this chair (although we are waiting to test it with the baby once he is born). It arrived quickly and in two easy-to-assemble pieces. The chair is large, plush and comfy (but not too large for a small-medium sized nursery). The color is perfect and seems like it would match just about any room. The fabric seems like it will be relatively easy to spot clean. The chair seems to be sturdy and durable. If it holds up we plan to use it in another room later.The chair reclines pretty far back, which is a nice feature and it is large enough to accommodate my husband, who is six feet tall. The swivel feature is nice to have, especially for a nursing mom who may need to turn to get supplies from a table, etc.Here are a couple of things that I don't love about the chair:- It seems to move in a little more of a rocking motion than a gliding one. It still moves quietly and smoothly so this is not a deal breaker for us but I thought it would be useful for people to know.- When the chair is reclined and/or the foot rest is up, it will not rock/glide. I suspect this is a safety precaution but I did not realize the chair would not rock when reclined. It does, however still swivel when in this position.- When the foot rest is open, there is visible black mesh/netting over the metal mechanism. I don't like that this can be seen but I think it is probably a safety precaution to keep little fingers from getting pinched so I plan to leave it in place.- The price of this chair fluctuates regularly. Keep an eye on the price and it may eventually go down... if it does buy it quickly before it goes back up.The bottom line is that I think the pros outweigh the cons of this chair (especially when comparing it to traditional styled gliders, which we did not want). Also, for the price (if you buy at a good time) you cannot go wrong!",4
Britax Marathon in Ashley Floral,"This is our third Britax car seat. I would say that in all we have owned 6-7 car seats prior to discovering Britax (I have 6 children). Once I bought our first Britax I knew I would never buy anything else, even though it cost much more then some brands. My youngest child is 18 months old and 6 months ago when it was time to turn her to a front facing seat my only dilemna was whether to get the roundabout or the marathon. I did end up purchasing the marathon although I know I would have been just as happy with the round-a-bout as that is what I have had in the past. 3 months after purchasing the seat I was in an auto accident with the baby in the car. It certainly could have been worse but we were hit hard and the car spun. When I looked back at the baby she hadnt budged an iota, and looked at me like ""what the heck was that"", but totally unharmed. I did need some medical attention and when the paramedic was removing the baby in her carseat to place it in the ambulance so she could come with me, she told me she had been in her job for over 10 years and had never seen a seat so well anchored into a car as this one was. I will say that we use the LATCH system and I do make sure it is secure, because no matter how good a seat is if it is not installed correctly it wont do much good. However I feel that Britax has made it easy to install the seat as it should be, it is not difficult to secure it tightly. I am glad that I had this seat and would highly recommend it",5
Token Board,"I barely ever write reviews but I had to about this product.  I absolutely love this token board!  It's simple yet effective.  I like that you can re-use the stars and I like that the board isn't overwhelming with words, pictures, etc.  My 3 and 1/2 year old son responded very well to it so far!  It's created a really nice positive change in our house.  FYI: Not only is it positive reinforcement (""if you can do this, you can earn a star"" but you can also ""take away"" a star for unwarranted behavior.  Both work great!)",5
Safety 1st Custom Fit All Purpose Strap,I absolutely can NOT stress enough how much I LOVE these locks! My son is 2 1/2 and can not figure them out and doesn't even waste his time trying which is amazing because he never gets up and is a wizard at all other forms of baby proofing I've tried.,5
"Summer Infant Multi-Use Deco Extra Tall Walk-Thru Gate, Bronze",We are using this in our living room with has a 48&#34; doorway and it works great. We use it to keep the dog away from the toys. My 3 year old son has no problem opening the gate on his own. You slide over something on top and then lift the whole door up. It also swings closed on its own. It doesn't always latch when closing on its own but that hasn't been an issue for us. Easy to put together and install.,5
Arm &amp; Hammer 10-Piece Nursery Fresheners,"Even though the description from the seller stated these would be lavender, all 10 that I received were citrus instead, which is not what I wanted.  Put one at the bottom of the diaper pail and couldn't smell it all, even though there were no diapers in it yet.  Disappointing.",1
Evenflo Embrace Infant Car Seat Base Black,This item was shipped to my home is less than 24 hours!  I was extremely impressed with the shipping speed and the price was great also!  Having a second base is going to be very helpful for my 2-car family!  I recommend this product to anyone with an infant!,5
"HALO SleepSack 100% Cotton Wearable Blanket, Print Boy, Large","The SleepSacks are a great alternative to blankets. No worries about my son pulling the blanket over his head but he still sleeps as snug as a bug. He owns 4 now, in two different sizes, and I love them!",5
Imse Vimse Organic Cotton Training Pants - Kiss The Frog Junior+,"These are great for LITTLE leaks. They are also cute and can be embellished for the look of bloomers for little girls. However, I was looking for a re-usable pull-up, and this is not something that works for that purpose. I did try putting my son's diaper liners in them for overnight use, but that did not work. They are just not meant to replace pull-ups. HOWEVER, for daytime use, sending little ones to limited childcare, such as an hour at the gym, morning play dates, baby sitter time, these are GREAT!!! I did find that my little girl was confused by them and wet them more often than with normal underwear, but that is not because the training pants malfunctioned. It is because she was only just 2 when we started using these and was too young to distinguish between them and a pull-up because they do have some bulk. I love Imse Vimse products and have always been impressed with them, and this product does work well for training little ones, particularly older toddlers.",4
"Trend Lab Cotton CribWrap Wide Rail Covers for Crib Sides (Set of 2), Pink Maya Dot","Very pretty and easy to put on grib, super cute for girls rooms and brown cribs, no damage to the crib and good fabric.",5
"Ju-Ju-Be Be Right Back Backpack Diaper Bag, Black/Silver",I was so nervous to buy this bag because I couldn't test it in person. I am so glad I bought the be right back. I have everything organized now its all quick and easy to get to. I love that I don't have to sling a bag over my shoulder anymore. I just throw it on my back and go also the bag never touches the floor I just put it on the back of chairs.I LOVE IT!!!!I would recommend this to any busy mom.Also this seller is wonderful I received my bag so fast.,5
Mother's Milkmate Breast Milk Storage Rack (10 Bottles),"I exclusively pump, so I store a lot of milk, and these are wonderful! They're made of a harder plastic than the medela bottles, and have held up perfectly in the dishwasher, and have a double seal closure. I have never had a leak from these. They are a little harder to scrub out due to the raised sections on the bottom, but it's not really a big deal as it only takes a few extra seconds to scrub. Overall they are high quality, and take up considerably less space in my fridge than other bottles or bags. A wonderful product, I will probably end up ordering more.",4
"Planet Wise Reusable Diaper Pail Liner, Foxy Frolic",We've been using these for four months and they still look brand new. We have two and wash them whenever we do diaper laundry so they've seen a fair bit of wear. The patterns are cute and the elasticated top holds really well -- we have ours on a simple-human slim step trash can and the size is perfect. They're also really well constructed. A big load of diapers can be HEAVY and these are sturdy.,5
"Karibu Baby Folding Bath, Blue/White","Best tub out there. Kids will fit in it for a long time. Well made and sturdy and you can buy a sling/hammock on ebay for $5,00-which by the way is exactly the same one I once saw Karibu selling here on amazon for $20,00(Type ""Baby Bathtub Seat Support Shower Net"" on ebay)and use it for newborn/infants. The white/blue Karibu/Babytrend tub is for sale at walmart website now for 30.00 dollars. I don't understand why it's so expensive now. When I bought mine on amazon a year ago it cost me 44.00. Some people say it is slippery, every tub without a ""stopper""(the place newborns rest their bottoms )will be slippery. Buy cute looking non-slip bathtub stickers or the simple and efficient "" 7,5"" Non-Slip Safety Shower Treads"". Look for them here. That's what I did and my son doesn't slip.",5
"Dutailier Ultramotion Cherry Sleigh Multiposition and Recliner Glider Rocker, Cocoa","Love this chair. It was simple to put together and is perfect for our needs. We recently adopted a toddler who has a lot of night-terrors and this chair is the perfect spot to hold her and rock her back to sleep. The only thing that keeps it from being a five star is that the arm cushions keep coming off, they are just a bit too tight for the velcro to stick to its self. We also got the matching ottoman, which unfortunately you have to order separately but which makes it even more comfortable.",4
Chewable Banana Brush,"Super soft and easily held, we purchased it for a child with high anxiety, she loves to chew on the soft bristles.",5
"Boon Sip Short Soft Spout Sippy Cup, 7 Ounce,Pink/Orange, 2-Count","Bought these Boon ""Sip"" cups in pink and orange for my 14 month old daughter. On second use she chewed the rubber coating off the spout and could have easily choked on the pieces. Feeling very lucky she did not. She has been using a variety of sippy cups for a long time and something like this has never happened. I contacted the company and they have asked me to send in the cup and said they will look in to it. We have been happy with other products from the Tomy Brand so I am hopeful they will. Still wanted to alert other parents. This cup could be very dangerous, especially to any teething age child using it!",1
"Dreambaby Extra Tall Swing Close Gate with Extensions, White","I ordered this gate to fit a 42"" doorway and the product description states that it will fit a 42.5"" doorway. When I received that gate in the mail and took out the instruction manual, it provided diagrams detailing how to use extensions to make the gate 39"" and how to make the gate 49"" (with extensions that are larger and not provided). I was ready to return the product but decided to take it out of the box and measure it and found that it actually does extend to 42.5"" but that the manual just doesn't show this configuration of extensions. We have had to return several baby gates because they wouldn't work with our baseboards, but this worked like a charm. It's nice that you can either screw these into the wall or use the sticky tabs provided- I chose to use screws and the gate doesn't budge. It feels very strong and secure- not cheap at all. I'm happy with the purchase so far- will update it if we have any issues!",4
Sozo All Star Swaddle Blanket &amp; Cap Set,Amazing,5
Regalo Easy Open 50 Inch Super Wide Walk Thru Gate - White,"love this gate easy to use for the baby and dogs, would recomened to everyone. easy to put to gether too.",4
Nature's Purest Sleepy Safari Bassinet,"I purchased this bassinet because I really liked how sturdy it was and its fairly neutral. Big mistake. The bassinet did not have the music/vibration box and the company was remarkably unhelpful when I tried to get it. I was told I had to send the entire item back, that the person I spoke with before was out sick so I'd have to wait for her to return, that no one could go down do the warehouse and look, that the product was discontinued and it was my fault for purchasing a discontinued item, etc. It took nearly two months for them to send me a replacement music box, and lo and behold it was the wrong one. Thanks, Summer Infant :| They wont return phone calls or emails, so purchase this product only if you're willing to deal with not receiving what you've paid for.",1
All Stars 6 Piece Crib Bedding Set,I just love this whole color scheme.  We painted our son's room blue and got every piece to this set. It is just such a nice change from the baby blue with pastel colored bedding sets.  It is definitely a little boy's bedding set.  Some many things match it outside of this collection too because of the blue and red combination.  The sheets wash well too which is a nice plus.,5
Amazing Tracker Ball Maze,"We do not own this toy but our local public library does and brings it out at the end of storytime. It is a hit every time even though by now 2 year old son attends storytime weekly. It is a popular toy from crawling infants to standing pre-schoolers. The only negative thing is that you have to watch out for the infants that are learning to walk/stand as they tend to climb this to stand and drop the balls through the top so it tends to tip over when they do this. However, it has held up at the library for years and no child has gotten hurt despite this.",5
"Shermag Glider Rocker Combo, Pecan with Oatmeal","We did a good bit of research before buying a glider.  This one seemed to be clearly the best value.  Nice styling, arrived OK with no damage from shipping.  Assembled easily with clear instructions.  Works well so far.  Good value for the money and functional.",5
"Fisher-Price Fastfinder Deluxe Fashion Diaper Tote, Brown Nylon",Fisherprice Diaper Bag is of high quality and has enough compartments to hold necessary items for baby. Worth the price!!Just one things needs modification- Wipes box doesnt close properly.,4
Photography Prop Crochet Cap Beanies Baby Hat Girl Boy Beanies Dinosaur Photography Hats Baby Animal Hat Cap,The buttons on the bottoms fell of the very first time I used this. Also the hat is very long. I'm not sure any babies head would be that long. Over all it was cute and made with okay yarn.,3
Maxi-Cosi Pria 70 with Tiny Fit Convertible Car Seat,"We've been using Britax for our boy (now 14 months old) since his very first moments leaving the hospital.  Thankfully, cost was not part of our consideration, so we went with the ""best"" seat we could find.  Britax has been good, but I wish we had found the Pria.  It's a terrific car seat!Three best parts so far:1.  Head control2.  Style3.  Cup holder4.  Soft, easy to clean fabricHead control - My biggest concern with other car seats has been his head.  When our son sleeps in the car, he tilts his head to the side, much like my father does now.  But with my Dad I don't worry too much, because he always seems to wake up after a few minutes and straighten out.  But babies don't seem to do that well, and I've been concerned that he's closing off airway or blood to his head.  I'm not a doctor, but it doesn't look good to me.  We've tried rolling his little blanket and stuffing it by his neck, like an airplane pillow...to no avail.  He just tosses it on the seat.  This seat has a great system for controlling his head.Style - This seat is attractive.  We never used the infant insert, but it has an elegant shape to it.  The rest of the seat looks good too.  I know its not a big concern, but I do appreciate great design.Cup holder - It has a perfectly placed cup holder.  We use the Uppababy stroller, and it has a great tray, where our son has become used to storing his ""cell phone"" and other things.  Without a cup holder close to his hands in our car, everything sits between his knees which makes it all tough to reach.  Pria's solution is perfect, and I don't find myself reaching into the back seat as much.Great fabric - We love the soft feel of this seat.  It's almost like a good pillow.  And the fabric has proven quite easy to clean.Overall, we're thrilled with the seat!Hope you enjoy yours, too,PhilUPDATE: It's been over a year now, and we remain thrilled with this seat. We kept the Britax so we'd have an extra seat in the car for James' friends to ride together with us. Night and day, this seat remains the hands down winner for easy buckling in, easy cleaning and comfort. And the cup holder continues to be the perfect place for drinks, snacks or a little toy car.Wasn't sure this seat would make it this long, as the fabric doesn't feel as tough as the Britax. But it sure has. Whatever they used is as easy to work with now as the day this one arrived. And remains easy to clean. We're having another one soon, so the Britax will be moving to the middle seat to make room for another Maxi-Cosi.Any recommendations on a new color?",5
Skip Hop Swipe Baby Wipes Case,"I think it is near perfect and so much better than regular wipes, but the red dot pops off at times and the case pops open occasionally.  Near perfect",4
"Blueberry Prints Diaper Laundry Bag, Lemon Lime","We have washed this about a bajillion times already, and it's holding up great. Cute and works perfectly; what more could you need? Blueberry products are my favorite.",5
Munchkin Travel Booster Seat,"I bought it for my 1 year old daughter, weight about 20 lb, for the trip during Christmas. The booster belt was broken on the second time we used it. Don't buy it!",1
Vilac Wooden Maracas,"These are a beautiful pair of maracas.  I'm sure you can find cheaper pairs (these cost TWENTY bucks), but these look lovely and appear to be sturdy.  I note the sturdiness because these were purchased for small children to play with, and I've had experience in the past with cheap plastic party maracas breaking easily and beads spilling out everywhere.  Not something you want to happen with small children around.",4
Greenbuds Organic Toddler pillow with Wool Fill,I really like this pillow. The cover it comes with is very nice and soft and the pillow cases they sell separate are very nice also. Great price too.,5
"C.R. Gibson First Year Calendar, Alex","This is a really cute calendar. calendar arrived as promised by seller. the calendar includes a lot of different stickers to place on calendar for all of baby's firsts. Calendar pages are left blank so you can fill in the month, day and date for each month. I have ordered 3 for different family members all due around the same time and all having girls",5
Tiny Love Classic Mobile,"I had gotten one from my sister and used it for my first son 2 years ago, it was awesome. I like how the little animals and rings move as the mobile spins. It has volume control of two levels and the light off or on and 3 levels of length of running.However, it sucks the battery power quickly. I am changing the 3 C batteries every three weeks and we don't even use it but 1-3 times a week, on the 15min setting.I guess I would still recommend it--just have your batteries ready!",4
"Skip Hop Bath Spout Cover, Moby",We purchased this item when my son started taking baths in the 'big' tub. I can't count how many times he has grated his back or hit his head off the whale and he never got a mark or hurt. Without the Whale he would have had many scars and probably hated the bath. It was hard finding a cover that accommodated for the shower pull. It went on nice and easy. We never take it off to dry like the picture shows. The whale tail is a great place for him to hang up his washcloth when he's done.Would recommend it!,5
Gus Nightlight Girl,"This turtle is great!  We have set the timer on the turtle to turn off after 30 minutes (it has two additional time settings or a standby option that stays on until the turtle is turned off).  My three year old is able to turn the turtle light back on throughout the night as needed.  The LED light keeps the turtle cool so he is safe to get tangled up in blankets and touch skin.  I was concerned that the LED light may be too bright, but that is not a problem with this product.  We will be buying another one for our younger child.",5
Bedtime Originals Curly Tails Musical Mobile,"I wish the hangers had some type of cover, but the musical is nice and the monkeys really cute. Good price and was deliver really fast. Musical match with the Soho monkey bedding set. I like it!",4
CoCaLo Daniella Crib Bedding Set 8 Piece,"Amazing crib bedding!! Really good quality, it matches perfect with a darker pink color in the wall too, I was afraid it wouldnt!!",5
"Munchkin 4 Pack Re-Usable Twist Tight Spill Proof Cup, 10 Ounce, Colors May Vary",The spout area shows worn after only one or two times of use because my two years old liked to chew on it while drinking. I stopped using it shortly. It's also hard to drink from so the child disliked it anyway.,2
Dr. Brown's Electric Steam Sterilizer,Worst strerilizer ever.Bought 4 months before my baby as born. Started using it and it turns off by itself every 2 or 3 hours of use and I cant use it when I need it.It appears this device is not intended for regular or severe use.Very very disappointed.,1
Sunshine Kids Stuff 'n Scuff Seat Protector - Black,"This is a very cheaply made product, and wouldn't lie flat against the seat-- a corner would always stick up oddly. If I forced that corner down, the opposite corner would just pop up instead. I tied it in place possibly every conceivable way, but it kept coming untied at the bottom anyway, and would not stay still. You know that wire and thin material manufacturers use for things like pop-up tents and cheap hampers? This is like that. My 2-year-old seemed to think it was a fun game to try to kick it off.Anyway, I recently gave up and threw ours away. It was more trouble than it was worth.",2
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","This is a very portable, nice-looking, and sturdy product. The buttons on the sides are not as convenient as some of the models that slide. I don't think we've ever used the top tray cover (the green part) because 1) are you really going to put food on this tray, cover it up, and transport it? and 2) you're probably going to clean off the random chunky food bits before you take the thing home. My husband thinks it's great and preferred it to other snap-on models, however I feed our kid more and have to deal with its &#34;quirks&#34; on a more regular basis (i.e. he's been able to easily pull off the white middle tray by himself since he was able to sit up straight in it!), so my standards are a little higher. Bottom line: this is a good seat with a neat tray system and good height adjustment features, but the side buttons and tray stability leave much to be desired.",4
"Diono Santa Fe Car Seat Booster, Shadow New Born, Baby, Child, Kid, Infant","I love this booster.  I actually have another one that is pink and gray for my daughter.  I love that this booster has latches just like their old car seats.  So you know the seat will stay in place.  I also love the fact that it has two cup holders, and that you can actually move the cup holders so they are hidden.  Just feeling it you know its comfortable.  It is well worth it.  I would not have bought any other kind.  I just wish there were more colors to choose from.  I know they have this gray and black and the purple one out now.  I thought blue would be cool.  I plan on buying one more for my husbands vehicle, I only have 2 kids.",5
"Starting Small Monkey Novelty Hamper in Brown,  18 x 11 x 24","I love that this was a cute design!  But sadly, the plastic rods that keep this basket standing, constantly fall out, and the thing crumples.  Plus when they are in, it never stays squared off and falls over a lot, until it's full of clothes.  The seems to keep the plastic rods are now fraying badly.  Will likely be purchasing regular hampers or baskets for my kids now.",1
"Summer Infant Fuze Stroller with Universal Adapter, Blaze","This is the type of stroller where &#34;you get what you pay for.&#34;  There are plenty of low-budget strollers to fit whatever budget you are working with.  However, if you are in a position to make a financial investment into a quality stroller, this is your item.  It has plenty of functional design improvements.  It handles babies as they grow.  The unit is of quality.  It is easily transformed into a car seat, so there is no need to purchase two separate items.  It is built to last and offers the type of investment that will be noticed once you see the unit.",5
"South Shore Savannah Collection 4-Drawer Chest, White",Started falling apart within a couple months.  Drawers won't slide in or out all the way.  Pieces are falling off.  Total waste of money and time putting it together.  Stay away from this product. My 4 year old daughter could have built better dresser out of q-tips and cotton balls.,1
"Sassy Baby Disposable Diaper Sacks, 200-Count","These are perfect little grocery bag type sacks to dispose dirty diapers into, especially when you're out with the lil one.  The scent is powdery fresh, and neutralizes stinky diapers without giving you a headache.  I can fit two dirty diapers and used wipes in each bag, making it super economical, and reducing the amount of plastic bags used.  I recommend this to anyone with a baby--YOU NEED THESE!!!",5
Graco Baby Einstein Discover and Play Entertainer,"Thank goodness we have this! Our son LOVES it and will play in it even when he's falling asleep on his feet!  The only ""bad"" part of it, in my opinion is how hard you have to press the pictures of the animals to get the sound or word. He's got it down now, but at 5 months when he started using it, he just couldn't do it.  He loves all the toys and works his way around the entire thing at will.  I like the adjustable legs that will allow this to grow with him. After reading some comments about choking hazards, I immediately checked his exer-saucer and found no cellophane anywhere, no paint or anything peeling and no ribbons on anything, and he chews on everything. We especially love the hand puppet to play with him while he's in it.  The tray is big enough to put cheerios on, for when he wants to keep playing through snack time.  We can put him in this and actually sit down and eat dinner (with him nearby, not unsupervised) or watch a TV show!",5
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,"I have tried all bottles and this one worked the best.  Avent made my baby gassy, Playtex nurser was to complex, Gerber he just did not like.  Than I found these.  I had no problem with stage 1 nipples, and now he is on rice in his milk and graduated to stage 2 and it works great.  I put mine in the sterilizer and it comes out clean all the time.  My husband caused it to leak one time by not putting it together properly, but I showed him and I have never had a problem.  I love these bottles and would recommend to everyone.  My baby had colic and this was such a great help.  Please try with Gripe Juice if you have a gassy or colic baby.",5
"Skip Hop Splash Bottle Dryer, Translucent","This is a really great bottle and breast pump parts dryer.  I have nothing bad to say about it.  I know others have had issues with water collecting on the bottom, I have not.  Great item.",5
Medela Pump &amp; Save Breastmilk Bags - 50 pack-5 oz,"I thought I'd love to be able to pump directly into these bags, but not so.  First of all, logistically you can only pump one side into one bag.  So you still have to dirty a bottle, or use two bags at each pumping.  And trying to pump into bags means there's no way to do it hands-free, because you have to hold the bags steady.Then there's the measurement markings.  They're not accurate.  So you have to measure the milk in a bottle before pouring it into the bag, which is an extra step.And the worst part of the bags is that they're not perforated right.  There's about 1/2 inch section in the middle that's not perforated at all.  So you can tear from both sides, but when you get to the middle if you don't use scissors, there's no telling how far off it'll tear.  What a mess!I haven't found a good bag yet, but this is definitely not it.",1
Munchkin Warm Glow Wipe Warmer and Diaper Bag Dispenser Set (Colors may vary),The wipes cool down immediately when you take them out. I don't remember this being such an issue with my warmer with my other babies... I do like the diaper bag dispenser set though- you can buy that separately and clip onto your diaper bag!,2
Safety 1st Froggy &amp; Friends No Slip Mat,"I bought this for my little girl to sit safely in the tub. IT doesn't work! IT doesn't stick to the bottom of the tub, it just keeps curling up and sliding around the bottom. More dangerous than just putting her in with out it. Would recommend you not purchase this item.",1
"Brica Baby In-Sight Mirror, Gray","We're still working on getting it to stay in place.  We've tried shoving a towel between it and the head rest, and now we're going to have to step it up, maybe with some tape?  Rope?  It's a little frustrating.  But when it works, it's great to be able to glance back and see my baby's face, ONLY when at stops or when traffic is light!  No gazing!!  :)",3
BABYBJORN Original Carrier - City Black,"I was hesitant about purchasing this carrier versus the less expensive models out there.  But the Bjorn has earned its keep in our household.  My son is now 4 months old and is happiest in his Bjorn.  It's great for mall trips, grocery shopping, walks around the neighborhood even when he's fussy while we're entertaining or eating at a restaurant.  I love having him close to me and he loves getting a bird's eye view of everything I'm doing.",5
Cloud B Tranquil Turtle - Aqua,"We love tranquil turtle, the pattern on the ceiling is so soothing, the sound could be louder but we use a different sound machine that stays on all night, so for us thats no big deal.  If you want the sound to be loud than this probably isn't the product for you, we were more interested in the waves on the ceiling, which my son loves.",5
Lifenest Sleep System,"I know 2 babies who improved their flat heads with the Lifenest! I am totally impressed. It is also a safe mattress that makes for babies' good sleep. This is a great product!I have been giving it out as a gift for baby shower and it makes for a great, useful present.",5
Infant Optics DXR-5 2.4 GHz Digital Video Baby Monitor with Night Vision,"I've never taken the time to write a review on Amazon until my recent experience with Infant Optics.First lets talk about the monitor.  It works, and works well.  It is easy to set up, is in color during the day and has night vision for night.  It's not exactly HD but who cares. It's easy enough for us to see if our little one is standing or lying, the difference between if she will fall back asleep or if we need to go comfort her.  It is also very durable as it has been dropped and dragged around and keeps on ticking.As a negative it does affect our wireless speed, but if we really need the speed then we just turn the monitor off until we go to bed and everything is fine.  Overall, 5/5Nor for the customer service review.  We bought this in July, 2012.  Last week the monitor quit charging so I checked and it has a 1 year warranty.  I emailed them about the problem and they quickly responded with some helpful tips to determine if it was the monitor or the charger.  After it was determined it was the charger, I informed them via email again.  They again responded very quickly (within 30 minutes) and sent me a new one with simply the order info from Amazon and no fuss or need to send back the old one.  Now thats customer service.  5/5I looked at other monitors and I simply don't think there is a better value than this.",5
Fishy Fascination Station,I'm not sure if its because my daughter is only almost 4 months but the toys does not really hold her attention very well.  She will look at it and touch it but it does not curb her from wanting me to pick her up.  The suction has its good days and bad days.  Usually when I wet the bottom before I put it on the highchair it sticks better.,2
4Moms mamaRoo Plush Infant Seat - Silver,"I had a swing the first few weeks my baby girl was born and hated it and ended up getting the mamaroo. Best decision ever. The mamaroo isn't a total eyesore in my living room, is easy to move, light weight, and takes up half the space that the swing did. Plus my baby likes the mamaroo A LOT better then the swing. I have no what it is about the mobile but she just stares and laughs at it , it just totally captivates her.The $100 extra you spend on the mamaroo over a traditional swing is worth every penny, hands down!",5
Doidy Cup - Orange color,"The cup works great. I got it for my son when he was maybe 1 1/2 and he could drink out of it just fine. The problem is if your child is young enough to need help drinking out of a cup then they are probably young enough that they think dumping out their cup and playing in the water is fun. My son is three now and well past the age where he can drink out of any cup just fine, until you look away for a second, then it's all over the floor. He still gets a sippy cup because it just plain messy other wise. This cup does exactly what it says it will but it was a waste of money for us.",3
"Baby Trend - Venture Travel System, Victoria",I bought this travel system for my daughter as a gift for my new granddaughter. It is exactly what she wanted and she loves it. It is very sturdy great price and good quality.,5
"Nickelodian Dora The Explorer 3 in 1 Potty Trainer, Pink","The top is great as a floor chair until she is ready to train. At first, it was a task getting her used to unassisted sitting but the big picture and bright pink color made it more of a game.",5
North States Supergate Extra Wide Wire Mesh Gate,Love the ease of putting it up for when we have our bunny out of his cage.  He can't jump over it and it works well for our dog also.,5
Britax B-Ready Lower Infant Car Seat Adapter,"I did not run into the issue where the stroller falls over when only the newborn is in the car seat in the back. However, I do have to disagree that the seat is not in the way when you walk. I have to pay attention not to kick the car seat, which makes walks a little awkward. I also don't see why they have to charge so much for this very simple piece.",3
Peg-Perego Skate Stroller System - Tango,"This stroller often gets poor marks for weight, but seriously, it's not much more than others in it's class. The weight is SO negligible when you are actually lifting it. And given all the AWESOME things this stroller can do, I gladly overlook any additional weight. I had a small compact stroller first, then I went to a full size, and finally am the most satisfied with the functionality and versatility of the Skate. I'm sticking with this one. I'm not returning it!My favorite things about this stroller are:1) The seat/bassinet can be raised or lowed into 3 different heights. The tallest setting is perfect for trips to the zoo or anywhere that has a railing that children need to see over. All the other strollers were way too low and my child either couldn't see, or I constantly had to take her out of the stroller at each exhibit. It's also perfect table height at restaurants, no need for the grubby restaurant high-chair, the Skate rolls right up and you're good to go!2) SO EASY to maneuver! It does seriously ""skate"", and you'd only know by actually pushing one. It has great shock absorption too.3) They do make a snack tray, where other manufacturers of similar models do not.4) Bassinet and chair are all in one... no need for extra accessories to take up space in my closet when not in use.5) Peg Perego's ""Freedom of Movement"" harness is a definite pro in my book. The only people that I've heard speak negatively about it have never actually ""owned"" a PEG!! Like I said, we've had 2 different strollers before this one and I found that my child was so much happier in her Skate stroller as she didn't feel confined and could actually lean forward when there was something she wanted to see. The child is safe, they are definitely NOT going anywhere... I thought this was such a smart a fabulous design. Ingenious really.6) Large canopy. LOVE the canopy. That's again another HUGE pro and required feature in my book as we live in a very sunny state...",5

"TL Care Organic Cotton Nursing Pads, Natural, 6 Count","I'm sure it's easy for many women to buy &#34;popular&#34; brands for nursing supplies, and I honestly bought these based on the few but all positive reviews and I'm so glad I did. These pads are so plush, thick and extremely absorbent. I don't even realize I'm wearing them, and they blend in well beneath an unlined nursing bra, tank, or sports bra.",5
Zo-li Bot Straw Sippy Cup 6oz,"I bought this a while ago and my son just could not get the hang of it. Once he did (at 11 months) he never puts the thing down, he loves drinking from this cup so much that I have to hide it or he will drink 3 cups of water. I love that he can get almost every bit of milk or formula because of the weighted straw but it leaks so much! He loves to throw his cups from his high chair and the plastic is pretty flimsy and I know it is going to crack soon. I wish for the price they made a sturdier cup. Milk or water are constantly leaking from the top and I don't know if it is coming from the straw or the lid. Had it been cheaper this wouldn't bother me as much",3
Primo Freedom Trainer (Toilet Trainer) (White),"I was a little apprehensive about ordering this product, as I read all of the negative comments.  I ordered it anyway, because good comments described the potty as one that would benefit my son. When it arrived (earlier than expected), I noticed that it was easy to assemble, and that because it is not made with very thick plastic, it probably wouldn't be a good idea to order this for BIG children who are potty training.  My son is 18 months old, and 22 lbs, and it is perfect for him, sturdy enough for him to climb up and use the potty.  He really enjoys climbing up himself, and it does encourage him to be more independent in the process.  I let him look at the box, and we talked about how the little girl was going potty, and he liked seeing the little girl on the box :) using the potty, ""just like him"".  So if your child is very big, or potty training at 3+ years, I wouldn't order this,they don't need it. I would just get a stool.",5

When her owl utensils aren't clean, next she asks for elmo!They are the right size for chubby little hands and she seems to use them quite well&#8230;they are very hard plastic and seem uncomfortable to hold (to me), but she doesn't seem to mind or notice.The spoon is a bit flatter than I'd prefer (for cereal and milk), however the fork tines are nice and sharp (not too sharp), and better for stabbing meats and veggies than some of her other utensils.We put them through the dishwasher and they hold up very well. I'd buy them again in a heartbeat. Too bad they won't make her eat broccoli!!!",5
"Momma Rocking Cup with Straw and Dual Handle, Orange",I purchased one of these cups it worked at first but after a few weeks it started to leak from bottom.

Prince Lionheart Complete Dishwasher Basket System,"These things annoy me pretty frequently because of how flimsy they are.  Maybe it's by design, but its just weird getting things to snap back together.  Its just cheap feeling... very cheap feeling..Also, one of the containers have this compartment that folds out from the bottom... which is also annoying.  Its made worse because you're doing all of this snapping and swinging with wet parts spilling all over the place.  It's messy and awkward.The round thing seems to waste a whole bunch of space, I assume its the perfect design for something specific, but I have not figured out what that is just yet.We bought this item to help with Dr Brown's bottles, and it does very little to help.. nothing fits anywhere and I'm always just rigging stuff in there.Save your money..",2
Snappi Cloth Diaper Fasteners - Pack of 3 (Mint color mix),"Snappis replace safety pins as fasteners for cloth diapers (prefolds).  They work on the same principle as the fasteners for ace bandages. They are so much faster & safer to use than the pins.  The colors are really cute, too.",5
"Kids Line Ultrasonic Cool Mist Humidifier, Flower","This humidifier looks cute, but that's about it. If you want humidity from it, you have to turn it up high and then it runs out of water overnight. It is also very difficult to clean well, which leads to mold build up in hard to reach places and I can only imagine in places that i cannot see as well. The last thing I want to do is run a humidifier in my infant's room that is growing mold!  I will be sticking with the Crane line of humidifiers; I have the owl and it works perfectly.",1
Summer Infant Breathe Easy Baby Crib Sheet - Sage Multi Dots,"This sheet looks great and washed well, but I just wanted to write a review and say that there are pink polka dots on these sheets.

"Graco Nautilus 3-in-1 Car Seat, Matrix",This car seat is great!

"Boppy Noggin Nest Head Support, Brown Wheels",The product is clearly well-made and of good quality. We bought it more as a preventive than as a correction. Its a bit awkward so we really don't use it as much as we should when baby is sleeping. But if I see it nearby when laying him down I usually lay it down first since I would feel terrible if he developed any flat areas.,4
Sassy Baby's Mam 5 oz. Boy 3 Pack Bottle,"My husband and I LOVE these bottles.  My son has been using them since he was 1 week old.  I have not had any issue with the ""gasket"" melting in a the dishwasher (I even use our sanitation rinse option).  I take them apart, place the gasket and nipple in our dishwasher basket on the top rack and they are ready to go!I do let all pieces dry thoroughly and carefully place them together.  You have to line up the bottle with the bottom part with gasket just right, if not they will leak.  Each leak we had was ""user error"" not a defect of the bottle.  I highly recommend these BPA free bottles and will not use another brand!",5

Playtex BPA Free VentAire Wide Bottle Newborn Starter Set (Packaging may vary),"I wish I had found these bottles sooner, it would have saved me a lot of money and trouble.  My twins have never been able to nurse effectively, so I have had a long ten months of pumping and experimenting with different bottles.  We have tried half a dozen other bottles, including Dr. Browns.  Dr Browns worked well in eliminating gas, but washing and cleaning the bottles were a headache.  Out of the box I knew these bottles were special because they were so easy to initially clean and sterilize.  Once I figured out how to assemble the bottles (it wasn't difficult) I tried them out on the twins.  Both of the babies immediately had no trouble switching from the Dr. Brown bottles to the Playtex, even though the nipple base is considerably larger.  Both babies burped easily after drinking their milk, but they didn't spit up (as they usually do)  In the week or so since the first use they still have not had any major problems spitting up, or being extra gassy.  Also, cleaning these bottles is a dream compared to the Dr. Brown bottles.  I do have to agree with the other poster who mentioned that you need to be extra diligent in cleaning the ""threads"" of the bottles, as they can yucky if you are not careful.  Overall, I wish I had found these bottles sooner, because they have made feeding (and clean-up) easier for me, which is important since I am working ""double time"" with twins.",5

JJ Cole Essentials Changing Pad &amp; Tote Set - Sky/Lemon,"Since buying this pad, I have replaced it with the one that came with my diaper bag.  It's just so much bigger and not easy for my son to roll off of.  I especially like how it can hold a good amount of diapers - four or five - and my wipes case (which didn't come with this pad).  Would've given five stars if it did come with a case.  Other than that a good product to have.",4
Child Airplane Travel Harness - Cares Safety Restraint System - The Only FAA Approved Child Flying Safety Device,This is a great product. Kudos to the inventor.  I bought this for my 2 1/2 year old grandson and he's taken 2 round trip flights using it.  It is convenient to put in your carry on and easy to install on the seat.  My grandson was confortable and secure and could use his hands and arms without restriction.  I will purchase another one for my 2 month old granddaughter when it's time.  My advice is to check the car seat and use this because it's less cumbersome.  Just don't forget to take it off the seat when you leave the plane.,5

JJ Cole Collections Strap Cover in Pink,"The straps are truly two-sided usable.  The wool side is the softest I have ever felt.  Nothing bumpy, just soft and cozy.  Would recommend using these right from the start though as my daughter kicked a fuss the first few times after adding them even though they were so soft and fluffy feeling.  Was in a car accident (without my girls) and added these to the straps now that I know what healing from car seat belt burns feels like.  Would not want my children to go through it.",5

"Graco Ready2Grow Classic Connect LX Stroller, Metropolis","I have owned a classic connect Ready2Grow stroller for about 2 months now. I have a 2.5 year old boy and a 3 month old girl. I LOVE this stroller!! I was a little apprehensive based on some reviews but decided to get it any way and I'm so glad I did.  It was very easy to put together. It is easy to fold up and easy to convert seating options.One of my favorite features is that you don't need to rearrange the seats at all to pop in a classic connect snugride infant car seat. You can just pop the car seat on either the front or the back seat at will. The front seat has a recline feature which is nice when your kid falls asleep in it. Also, the seat folds forward to provide an easy way to access the carob space. The cargo space is nice and large and can also be accessed from the rear.  I also think it's easy to take off the upper seat to convert to bench seating.The stroller is very well made and sturdy which is good because my son climbs everything. He has climbed up the front and the back to get into the stroller by himself. I don't like him to do this but the stroller did not tip or anything.In my opinion, people who feel this stroller is too big or too heavy have unrealistic expectations for a double stroller. I have taken it to the zoo a few times already and I think it is reasonably easy to lift. It fits in the back of my Subaru Forester (small SUV) just fine.It is true that the rear seat cannot face forward and the rear seat does not have a cup holder. The front seat has two cup holders and a snack tray. The parent tray has a fold-out cup holder and a nice tray for snacks and your phone.I love this stroller. We use it almost every day and I highly recommend it.",5
"Combi Shuttle 33 Infant Car Seat, Indigo","I bought this car seat for my first child. We have owned it for just under 8 months. My son is about 1-2"" away from outgrowing the height limit but he still only weighs about 18-19lbs. He fits (and always has, with the seat inserts)well and actually prefers this car seat to the convertible car seat in our SUV. The combi fits well in the back of my VW Passat and when I had the installation checked at the firehouse the officers were actually calling people over to demo the anti-rebound bar :) . I really like this car seat (SUPER light compared to the other car seats we looked at) and actually have a friend with the same seat whose 2 year old somehow still fits in it! She doesn't like the buckle mechanism but I don't really have any issues with it. The only thing I am disappointed about is I can't adjust the handle or canopy (had to detach it) with the headrest expanded to the height required for my son. My husband loves this car seat and so does my son. We highly recommend it.",5
"OXO Tot Straw Cup, Aqua, 11 Ounce","I bought this because I was looking for a sippy cup for my son that had a straw because he still sits in a highchair and there isn't a lot of room to tip his head back to get a good swig from a regular sippy cup.  This cup is very easy for him to use.  The reason I give it 4 stars is because of how easily it leaks.  He is one, so it regularly gets chucked overboard and spills immediately.  It does seal if you twist it completely closed, but a baby is not going to do us that favor every time they chuck it.",3
Zo-li Bot Straw Sippy Cup 6oz,"Our son would not use a straw cup until we got this cup when he was around 14 months. I would recommend getting one to anyone who wants their child to transition from bottle or regular sippy to straws.Pros:easy to drink fromlid always attached to close top for inside bagnice colors/design is modern and cleanweighted straw means child can get everything in cupStill works for kids who automatically tilt all cups back like a sippy/bottleCons:If not threaded properly it can leak out the top side (has happened a couple times to us, but not a lot)you do need a straw/sippy cleaner tube to clean out these straws. And you can detach and clean the weight but it takes time.Does not hold a lot of oz for toddlers, wish they had a larger size cup because I have to refill it a lotNot insulated for milkHard to find locally (Nordstrom kids has them usually though) & pretty pricey. But they last longer then the $6 playtex straw cups etcOverall I would buy it again (we have 2 of them now) because it helped our son learn how to use a straw and they rarely leak for us. Plus our son uses a regular sippy & straws so he doesn't get frustrated at this cup if he tilts it back because he can still get all the liquid out. Other straw cups I would recommend if you dont want to spend as much $$ are NUK straw active cup & Munchkin mighty grip. Flukes for us are all playtex cups we have tried (leak horribly).",4

"Boba 3G Baby Carrier, Montenegro Black","COLOR CHOICE: I ordered the Lila because its pretty and now regret the black fabric because, as baby faces me his drool, snot, crumbs all show very clearly all over the straps which are near his face. I would choose a lighter fabric like the Dusk or Safari if I had it to over again.This carrier is very comfortable, especially in the back carry. The straps don't hurt my shoulders as with cheaper carriers like the Infantino or Eddie Bauer. I've been using it with my 12 month old for 3 months now who is 21 lbs. Front carry hurts my back if I do it for long simply because of his weight. I usually can't transfer him to my back without help but have heard that when he is older and can help maneuver himself it will get easier. I prefer the back carry position, it is so comfortable I could forget he's back there!",5

We haven't had any leakage, even when the fitted diaper is totally soaked. We haven't had any blow outs either. We've had a few blow outs with the Pampers disposables which has motivated my husband to start change into the cloth diapers on his own.The velcro tabs hold well when during wash, even on the heavy duty cycle, and Thirsties diapers haven't been the source of any diaper chains.  I like the colors, but I wish Thirsties would make more fun designs instead of all solids.",5
"Skip Hop Funspot Activity Centre, Circles",I love love love these! We got them when my baby was about 6 months and had recently started sitting up but wasn't great at it yet.

I am definitely glad I spent the extra money to get the skip hop mat and the activity spots!,5

I've washed them at least a dozen times and they come out squeaky clean and in one piece. Baby wears these over pinned gmd prefolds, and we have no leaks. They are really fluffy but smoosh to barely there under clothes. Baby has super chunky thighs (and everything else, she's a real chub;) and they leave no red marks on her tummy or her thighs.  I am truly and honestly impressed with the quality of the diaper covers. The price is crazy cheap, especially since you get two pair. These are truely a hidden gem in the world of fluffy bum'ed baby's.",5
Crib Flannel Sheet -2 Pack (Mocha Dot),"Soft, good quality, and right-priced. They wash up beautifully, and in fact seemed to get softer after washing.  My granddaughter takes a bottle to bed with her, and the resultant dripped milk doesn't stain.  We'd buy these again.",5
Edushape Edu-Tiles 16 Piece Edges &amp; Corners Set for Playmats,We bought this along with the tiles about an year ago and our toddler DD has been playing on it ever since we received it.

It gives you three options for hanging:  two points along a wall, three points in a corner, or four points from the ceiling.  It works fantastic.  Only thing I suggest is to drill holes into the wall(s) or ceiling before you put the anchors in.  If not, you will destroy the anchors.",4

NTM-910YIC - Sony Baby Call Nursery Monitor,"This is the second baby monitor I have purchsed to watch over my grandson as he sleeps. The first was a Fisher Price one (junk as it didn't even last a year). I love this one for its simplicity, yet its features as well. First, it stays silent while it is on. The Fisher Price had a wall of static noise when it was turned on. This one only activates with noise. It also has the lights that indicate sound coming in and it has numerous frequencies to choose from. I would say, for the price, you cannot go wrong with this product.",5

Basically you just charge the unit and its ready to go.  We don't  use any night lights in the baby's room and I was able to see my baby perfectly. The settings on the monitor helped  adjust for our needs. I purchased this monitor for my 3rd child and I wish I would have had this monitor for my first two as well.  I liked how the louder the baby cried  more lights would appear with red indicating a loud cry. I thought this feature was really helpful.  I really liked the size of this product. The monitor and camera are small and easy to move around verses my former large bulky monitor.  I also liked how easy it was to adjust the angle of the monitor for different views of the crib. As a mom of three, I rate this product very highly and would recommend it to any other mom.",5

I was surprised at how much it collected the first time I used it! So glad to not be wasting liquid gold into a breast pad or my shirts or the sheets. I would've loved to have had this right when my milk came in and for the first few months of breastfeeding! This would make a good shower gift!",5
HALO Cotton SleepSack,These are a must have. Safe and secure plus keeps your little one cozy at night. I put my little girl in a long sleeved onsie and with the cotton she is at perfect temp. We also had the fleece when it was winter time.,5
"Mud Pie Baby Classic Keepsakes Silver-Plate Rattle, Cross",It was bigger than I thought and my granddaughter hit herself in the head with it the first time she played with it.  It is well made and has a good silverplate on it.,5
Chicco Cortina KeyFit 30 Travel System in Adventure,"We replaced a Graco Metrolite Travel System that had worn out with this Chicco Cortina KeyFit 30 Travel System.  In general we are very pleased with it.  A few pleasant surprises were the quality of the tires and suspension relative to the Metrolite and other similarly priced systems -- it is durable and smooth.  Another pleasant surprise has been how quick and easy the fold/unfold are.  The differentiator verus other systems is that it locks/unlocks without needing a clip or strap.  The only real negative we see is the storage basket.  Since there doesn't seem to be a way to &#34;open&#34; it, it becomes almost unusable when in a reclined position or with the infant seat in it.",4
Rocking Moses Basket Stand Expresso,"We used the UB Vista Bassinet for baby's main sleeping bed during his first 3 months. We didn't want to spend a fortune on the UB's overpriced bassinet holder, so we looked at this option. The bassinet doesn't fit perfectly, it's a little bit smaller, but nothing concerning. If you really plan on rocking the thing, the size difference might pose a problem, but otherwise, the bassinet fits just fine. Actually, we probably did rock it a little bit when baby was very new born and because he was so little, it didn't shift around at all. It was probably when he was a little bigger that we had to be more careful if we chose to rock it (but even then, we barely did).Constructing the thing was simple, but it's kind of like Ikea...hit or miss. I recall that some of the holes weren't perfectly aligned, so it was a pain at times. We still think it was a worthy purchase to avoid buying the UB one.",4
Klean Kanteen 18 oz Stainless Steel Water Bottle (Sport Cap 2.0) - Indicator Red,"Bought this for my 5 yr old daughter who no longer wants to use a leakproof sippy cup.  Works great, no leaks.  The very small sqeaky noise when you drink doesn't bother us at all because the leakproof sippies do the same thing.  It is possible to eliminate the squeaky noise by pushing down the little valve in the top while drinking, if you need to.  Nice and sturdy, fits in the cupholder pocket of my diaper bag and in the cupholder pocket of her school backpack and lunchbox.  Nice color pink, not obnoxious.",5
Winnie the Pooh Window Valance by Kidsline,I liked winnie the pooh but the rest of the vvalance was off balance and it looks funny with pooh over to the side.,3
"Summer Infant Ultra Plush Change Pad Cover, Blue",This product does the job just fine. It also seems to be pretty comfortable. Its easy to clean as well.,5
"joovy Foocot Quilted Mattress Pad, White",This pad adds a little cushion to the cot.  I am glad we got it since the cot is very firm.,4
Disney Phineas and Ferb 8&quot; Perry Plush,"We chse this ""plush"" figure for our daughter for Christmas.  I was a little taken back by the price.  But, we wanted a Perry!  When it arrived, we pulled a cell-phone-sized package out: it was the squished Perry!  Once we got him to regular size, we were shocked to see that a label had been taped over the original label.  This is a 10 inch Perry the Platypus Beanbag sold by Disney Store.  We immediately returned it and bought a much better substitute: the 20"" Talking Perry form the Disney Store (for $24.99)",1
"OXO Tot Divided Feeding Dish, Aqua","I got this bowl because my 6 month old daughter is getting to the stage of trying to feed herself.  This design lets her muck around while I still have a good grip on it.  It's very lightweight, and easy to pick up, so great for letting her pick up and bang around when the food's gone, too.The two sides are great for keeping cereal and fruit or veg separate. And if she's not interested, I can pop the lid on and try again later.  It's even ended up turned sideways in the fridge, and not leaked. All around, I'm very pleased with it.",5
Mary Meyer Christening Lamb Blanket - 14 Inches,This blanket was bought for a baptism present.  It is very nice and soft.  It seems just the right size.  I would buy another for any other baptisms that I needed a gift for.,5
Safety 1st Lift And Lock Security Gate,We bought these shortly after having our daughter. They worked well as hard mounted gates at the top AND bottom of stairs and pressure mounted between rooms. We love the fact that you can slip the gate out of the mountings if you only want to remove it temporarily. very easy to use one handed once adjusted (even while holding the baby).,5
"Nurtria BPA Free Nipple Shields, 2 Pack, Silicone","I have tried a few different brands of shields to try to get my baby to nurse effectively, and so far these are my favorite.  I have found that most shields have large holes for the milk to come through, and my skin ends up coming through as well and this is very painful.  These shields are very flimsy, but the holes are smaller and therefore much more comfortable in that aspect.  The biggest con that I can see is that they are smaller in the middle so they are a little awkward to place.  But because of the flimsy material, they are not terribly difficult to place and I can feel the baby nursing much better and he is able to nurse more effectively emptying the breast with little trouble.  This was not happening with the other brands of shields.  So I give this product 4 stars even though there are a few flaws.  But I am purchasing more, if that gives you any idea of how I feel about it.",4
"Baby Banana Bendable Training Toothbrush, Toddler","We ordered this toothbrush as a first toothbrush for our baby girl once she got a couple of teeth in.  We wanted to get her used to brushing her teeth as well as actually cleaning her teeth and gums.Initial ImpressionsWhen we first got the toothbrush, we didn't use any toothpaste, we just wet the brush and ran it over the front and back of her teeth and gums.  Our baby immediately took to the brush and like the feeling of the bristles as well as the clicking sound the bristles made as we brushed her teeth.  We also used it to brush her tongue.  She seemed to take to this routine immediately, and would even open her mouth when she saw the brush coming.After a few weeksAfter a few weeks of using the brush, our baby girl suddenly got much more fussy when using the brush.  She would turn her head away when she saw the brush coming and start screaming.  Once we got the brush in her mouth, she would usually stop squirming and let us brush, but it no longer seemed such a pleasant experience.  I don't think it had anything to do with the brush itself, unless the novelty just wore off.  It could have been due to sensitivity from more teeth coming in or any number of things.  But there were  a couple of weeks where she really didn't like to brush.Back to liking the brushJust as suddenly, she started liking the brush again after a while.  Opening her mouth and sitting still whenever we brush her.  This again reinforces the notion that it wasn't the brush so much as what she was going through at the time.  The brush is very easy to use and fits well in her mouth.  I'm able to brush both the front and back sides of her teeth and gums, and she seems to tolerate me brushing her tongue as well.Using some tooth gelAs she started getting more teeth (about 8 teeth now), we began using the Weleda Children's Tooth Gel 1.7 oz toothpaste as part of the brushing routine.  We just scrape a tiny bit of tooth gel onto the brush and brush as usual.  This also works very well, and her breath is minty fresh after brushing!  So far, we are very happy with the performance of the brush.  We haven't experienced any bristles falling off at all, the brush is easy to clean (much easier than a regular tooth brush), and our baby still seems to like it.  I would definitely recommend this brush to others!",5
bumGenius Diaper Sprayer,"As advertised, it sprays off poo from those nasty diapers. I'd call that a win. No problems with leaks, I appreciate the ability to adjust the pressure with the valve connected to the toilet. BE SURE YOUR TOILET HAS A FLEXIBLE HOSE ATTACHED BEFORE THIS ARRIVES so you can save yourself an annoying trip to the hardware store when all you really want to do is spray that crap into the toilet. Seriously!",5
Eddie Bauer Musical Rocking Bassinet Cherry,"My husband and I thought this bassinet would be perfect for our new baby--not too frilly and with a classic look. We were very disappointed. The only thing that is machine washable is the pad cover. Everything else must be hand washed! Also, it doesn't rock automatically, a feature that was somewhat implied. So I can rock it myself right? BARELY! It has very little motion and when it reaches its furthest point it makes a knocking noise that is sure to wake napping babies. While it is still a good-looking bassinet, it is must less functional than they would have you believe. Pass on this until they can improve on it.",2
Summer Infant Deluxe PiddlePad,"I haven't had the best of luck with this product. I bought it for my daughter, who is potty trained but sometimes on long trips, if she falls asleep and has an accident, I still end up having to take out the carseat and wash that along with the piddlepad.",2
"Nuby 3 Pack Tinted Bottle, 10 Ounce, Colors May Vary",This is working out great for my son. I never find these in stores and I am so thankful that Amazon carries it since my son won't take any other bottle. Not much spilling and very sturdy too.,4
"MAM 3-Pack BPA Free Bottle, Boy, 5 Ounce",My son is exclusively BF but we had to get him used to taking a bottle for my return to work. I tried several expensive brands of bottles and even the slow flow nipples were too fast for him. He will only take the Mam brand and there is no mess. I've had no problems with leaking and love the self sterilization and ability to take apart for a good cleaning. The are the most functional and affordable for us. I LOVE Mam products!,5
"North States Superyard Play Yard, Grey, 6 Panel","Having just received the play yard, we set it up in our living room so that our 14 month old can have some safe space for moving around and playing with toys.  The simplest comment is that you get what you pay for and this is a China-made plastic fencing.  It is safe and light and prevents the child from going where they shouldn't go.  It is ok to assemble, as it can be a bit tricky to get the pieces to interlock but it works well enough to configure the shape to work within your room.  Another reviewer mentioned the lack of aesthetics and this is truly not an item of beauty... but it does the job.",4
"OXO Tot On-the-Go Wipes Dispenser, Pink","I should have paid better attention to the reviews. I guess I figured their dispensers weren't closing properly because they were over-stuffing them, but it doesn't matter how many or how few wipes you put in it - the sides don't close completely. I just couldn't believe OXO would make a wipes dispenser that had sides that didn't close completely. I still can't believe it, but that's exactly what this is. It's not worth the trouble of returning it, but it is a rip off. I'm also annoyed that people are giving it 4 and 5 stars and saying &#34;OMG IT'S SO AMAZING I LOVE IT IT'S THE BEST&#34; and then at the very end saying &#34;Oh the sides don't close but no big deal I just use loads of rubber bands and kite string to hold it closed.&#34; Sorry, but if I have to MacGyver it to stay shut, it's not a 4 or 5 star product.",2
"Best Bottom Stay Dry Inserts, Large, 3 Count","They are super absorbent and incredibly soft, even after being washed and used repeatedly.  I love best bottom covers and the inserts live up to the name as well.  I have nothing negative to say about these at all!",5
Cloud b LullaWrap Flannel Swaddling Blanket Blue,"Purchased this to send to day care because we were swaddling at home but didn't want to send my SwaddleMe's to school every day. I will swear up and down by the SwaddleMe's and cried the day he finally grew out of them...but he LOVES this blanket.  Not only did it take longer for him to outgrow this blanket as a swaddler, but he also continues to use it as his blanket now that he's in the ""big boy"" class.  In addition, this is a wonderful company to work with.",5
Snoogle Chic Total Body Pillow,My wife LOVES this so much; I can't say how it actually feels as she will not give me a chance to use it :),5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"Little did I know when ordering Freddie (with some misgivings that a plush toy would cost around eleven dollars) that he would become an indispensable part of our world. I read all the rave reviews, thought they were probably a little over the top, but figured I'd give him a shot. Since our baby has been two weeks old she has been captivated by Freddie. She started out really liking his black and white side, but now also enjoys his colorful one. It is amazing to me how many features have been packed into this firefly: different colors, textures, a mirror, a squeaker, a teether and crinkly wings, not to mention a handy clip to attach him to almost anything (playmat, stroller, bouncer chair, diaper bag).My only real gripe with Freddie is that the tag says to hand wash only. That being said, I've read several reviews stating that Freddie has survived the washing machine AND dryer, so maybe washing by hand isn't an absolute must. I myself might try the washing machine but am a little leery of putting him (and his cellophane-filled wings) into the dryer. I'm worried a very important of him might melt.Could Freddie be any better? Maybe - if he played music or something. But honestly, this is one toy that is totally worth it. I've even ordered a back up Freddie so he can be in the car with us at all times.Thanks to Lamaze for thinking up such a great toy, and especially to all of the reviewers before me who convinced me to buy this.",5
"Skip Hop Versa Diaper Bag, Cream Links","I liked this bag for the most part, but the zipper just ripped away from the fabric after ten months of low to average use.",2
"Britax Stroller Organizer, Black","Doesn't quite sit correctly on the stroller handle.  Not good for hot drinks, as they still splash when pushing the stroller.",2
"Graco Nautilus 3-in-1 Car Seat, Matrix","i recieved this convertible car seat from my mom. we were undecided about which seat to get. but after i started to research which convertible seat was rated in the top 5, i knew this was the one. easy to install and very comfortable for him. it fits in most vehicles. i would recommend this seat for anyone who wishes to have the best for the baby.",5
Regalo Easy Diner Portable Hook-On High Chair,This chair was obviously returned by someone else before they repackaged it and shipped it back out to me. I had and long gouge in the paint where two of the pieces were supposed to fit together. It was also bent and would not go together properly. I was very disappointed to receive a returned/damaged item.,1
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Swaddle, Soft Pink, Newborn",We purchased this for my son after his long stay in the NICU. These are so much better than blankets. They are so soft and last longer than the recommended usage due to the length.,5
"Gunamuna Gunapod Wearable Blanket Party Collection, Purple/Cocoon, Large","I have used several other brands of wearable blankets (and swaddlers when the squeaker was smaller).  This (and the other Gunamunas) are by far my favorite.We have a 27lb 13month old, who is walking and climbing and partially co-sleeps (the crib is &#34;sidecar&#34;).The kid HATES blankets (and we're still a bit twitchy about SIDS), so this is the perfect solution:1. the zippers are impressive.  They don't get caught up on the fabric, they're sturdy, and they have allowed me to put this on him when he isa.  sleeping (without waking him up!)b.  trying to flip over, unwilling to stay still for the TWO SECONDS it takes to get the thing on2.  This particular sleep blanket is my favorite for cooler nights- it is the coziest feeling fabric and it seems quite warm3.  We like these for camping as well- his own personal sleeping bag4.  Fits our 27lb guy with room to kick and room to grow5.  Keeps the early AM gymnastics to a minimum.  He is able to roll and awkwardly crawl in it, but not climb his crib or move very quickly, or sleepwalk (yeah, he does that)Overall, this is a keeper for future bambinos once he outgrows it.Additional points for cuteness and washability.",5
"Bedtime Originals Bumper, Magic Kingdom",Cute colors. Nicely made and I highly recommend.,5
Safety 1st On-the-Go Fold-Up Booster Seat,"We bought this booster because the restraint system on high chair wasn't designed to hold a child into the seat and our 14 month old daughter learned that she could stand up in the seat while buckled in.  After 2 days, we think this booster is great!  She loves to eat at table height, the restraint is excellent, and after making sure to really tighten the straps that fasten it to the chair, the fit is very snug.  I checked the straps and re-tightened today, fyi, might want to check with frequency that they stay tightened.  We are planning on traveling next week and plan to take it with us.  We haven't used the tray, it's small, but then again, it's supposed to be a portable seat.  In response to the comment regarding the classic wooden high chair... we have a small place so we thought we wanted something that would be inconspicuous and fit in with the furniture.  The wooden high chairs are high maintenance as far as cleaning!  There is no ""hosing it down"" in the shower, like I've heard other moms do with their plastic chairs, and the seat pad is cloth, so it too is a chore to keep clean.  We took ours off and found that the wood veneer started to peel on the seat from wiping with a damp sponge after each meal... I would now choose plastic and low maintenance over aesthetics any day!",4
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,It was a much better price for this via amazon.  Toys R Us were outrageous.  It was deceiving how big it would be by the picture.  I didn't read the information.  So when I got it I was pleasantly surprised.  Nice quality and size was big.  Our grandson will enjoy this for many years to come.  Lamaze makes great products.,5
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray",This is great for taking to see the grandparents or visiting anyone else. Very light and portable and easy to attach to any chair.  Also cleans up fast!,5
JP Lizzy Satchel Designer Diaper Bag - Sherbert,Bought diaper bag for sister as a gift. Lives it can fit everything thing she needs for my nephew n herself!! And it comes with a changing mat!!Great product! !,5
"Dream On Me Deluxe Toddler day Bed, White",Met all of our needs. pretty sturdy and easy to put together. Very low to the ground which is good if/when my son falls out.,5
"Peg-Perego Skate Stroller System, Java","I've been using this stroller for a few months now so I felt I should write a review. First the good things, I really like this stroller, it has a very smooth ride when I push it and my son falls asleep right when he gets into it, he loooves it. You can really push it with one finger it is so easy to push. It's great that the Peg Perego car seat snaps right into the frame, it makes things a lot easier! (He loves the car seat too) It doesn't look like there is a lot of room for storage at the bottom but it actually holds quite a lot, with or without the basket. However, there are a few things that I don't like, it's VERY difficult to get open from the closed position. You have to use your foot and both hands, I'm short and it's difficult for me to do... you have to be pretty flexible! If you're a tall person it could be almost impossible. At least it's easy to close though. When it is in the open position there is only one little piece of plastic that keeps it from colapsing, it holds but every time I put my infant in it I'm afraid it's not going to hold... I don't know how I will feel when he is 20+ pounds. One more thing is the bassinet, for some reason I can not get it to lay completely flat, it either tilts to the front or back and my son ends up scrunched toward one end... maybe I just need to play around with the settings a little more. It takes a while to learn how to work this thing too, it's quite complicated! I got this stroller on sale, I would say it isn't worth 800.00+ because I'm sure their are strollers just as nice for cheaper, but if you want the name and a stroller that is east to push and looks slick then get this one!",4
"Moby Wrap Original 100% Cotton Baby Carrier, Red",It is quiet thick cotton and makes my baby very hot. It shrunk a little after washing although i followed the washing instructions.,4
Mother's Milkmate Breast Milk Storage Rack (10 Bottles),"I really like the design of this system. It keeps the bottles very organized and tidy. I use them w/ a Medela electric pump and they adapt perfectly....no fit problem whatsoever. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is the plastic lid inserts warped a little bit when I sterilized them. They can still fit in the mouth of the bottle, but I have to really play with them....other than that - great system!Note: my bottles arrived with white lids, not the pink as pictured. Not a huge issue, but it surprised me nonetheless.",4
Precious Moments&reg; Prayer Doll - Girl,The doll is very cute and appears as pictured. I was a little surprised when I heard the doll speak. The voice is sweet but has a little bit of a southern drawl. I think the drawl adds some character though.,4
Evenflo Snugli Front &amp; Back Pack Carrier,"This is the only product that my husband and I registered for where we did no research about brands.  After receiving it, and actually asking around, we realized that we had made a mistake.  There are multiple snaps and straps, and although I've found a relatively quick way to place my daughter in it, it is still way more time consuming than other brands.  I've watched mothers in my playgroup quickly slide their babies into their Baby Bjorns and other similar products, while I am still standing there snap, snap, snapping.  Furthermore, the headrest that was supposed to assist my daughter when wearer-facing has become quite a hindrance now that she is forward-facing.  I have recently gone to a store and tried out other carriers with my daughter and none of them bring on the lower-back-pain that I have wearing this carrier.  If you want to save money and do not plan on wearing this carrier often, maybe this would be the carrier for you.  But now I will have to go out and spend more money to buy something that works quickly, easily, and pain-free!",2
Evenflo Summit Easy Walk-Thru Gate,"This is a really great baby gate, I have it placed at the bottom of my stairs and the adjustable tension is really nice because we live in an old home and it seems none of our doorway openings are the same widths. We have a plastic baby gate that would not work in this spot because the bottom would be tight and the top would be loose and wiggly, which meant it would fall but since the tension for the top & bottom can be adjusted I can make it fit! Another great feature is the bars only going in the vertical direction, my other baby gate is not this way and my 1 year old can climb over it by putting his little feet in the holes and climbing it, this gate does not allow him to do that! I am very happy I purchased this gate and would recommend it to anyone looking to keep their little one safe!",5
"Baby Deedee Sleep Nest Baby Sleeping Bag, Dream Blue, Small (0-6 Months)","My husband and I are very pleased with our sleep nest. Not only does it keep our baby warm in his own crib, it served as something familiar for our baby as we stayed with family over the holidays. I had comfort and peace of mind knowing my baby was safely warm at night, and I slept better because of it!",5
My First Easter Basket &amp; Photo Album Gift Bundle,"Love the little basket, and the other items, but as soon as the baby put the chicken in his mouth, one of the feet came apart. For that reason, I wouldn't recommend it",2
"Peg Perego Baby Cushion, White","The cushion is exactly as pictured and fits perfectly into the stroller, although it would be better if the side slats are cut a little deeper. Another plus is that it doesn't have to be removed to close the stroller even though the cushion padding is quite substantial.",4
"Bloom Nano Urban High Chair, White Frame With Seat Pad Henna Brown",This highchair is wonderful!! My daughter has been using it since she was 4 months old. The style makes it easy for young babys to sit and enjoy mealtime before they actually start eating solids. The leather is super easy to clean. The base is very sturdy and strong. There is no wobbling at all! We have two dogs and I love knowing that even if the chair gets bumped its still going to stand strong. The third thing I absolutely love is that the tray is so wide. She has a lot of space to play and eat. The way it is set up makes it easy for the food to stay on the tray and not reach the floor. Wonderful wonderful product!! I highly recommend.,5
"green sprouts 10 Pack Waterproof Absorbent Terry Bibs, Girls","These bibs are the best I've tried so far (out of about 6 different brands). I have purchased at least 3 sets of 10, in both the boy and girl colors.Pros:-beautiful, color-fast colors-big variety of colors in one 10-pack. I can always find a bib to match whatever outfit he is wearing.-absent of cutesy distracting baby designs and obnoxious patterns. My 16-month old has been wearing bibs all day every day for a year, and I very quickly got tired of seeing bibs with ""MONKEY BOY"" or ""POWER DROOLER"" all over them. They are a part of his wardrobe, and I want them to be as inconspicuous as possible.-soft-absorbent-truly water resistant: there is a waterproof layer sandwiched between the two layers of terry cloth-strong velcro-both the fabric AND the velcro stay perfectly flat after repeated washings, rather than buckling or curling from the dryer like many others I have gone through-the strong velcro STAYS strong after repeated washings, not getting weaker or with repeated use or exposure to the dryer (also like many others I have gone through)-perfect size...not too big, not too small-really decent price for a pack of 10 in my opinionConsiderations:-You must make sure that the velcro is closed (scratchy velcro half fastened to the soft half of the velcro) when you wash them with other delicate fabrics, like a satin-feel baby blanket, or the very strong velcro will catch those delicate materials. To me, this is a common-sense laundering issue, not a product flaw, hence my rating of 5 stars. You also have to make sure the velcro is fastened well (that the two pieces match up, no overlapping, etc.) when you put it on your baby. Since the velcro is very strong (and scratchy when opened), it can irritate sensitive baby skin. Again, a common sense issue, since all you have to do is make sure the two velcro halves match up when you fasten the bib, then no scratchy parts are exposed to skin. Again, common sense and in my opinion not a product flaw.Edit on 3/27/2013:  I am now using the very same bibs on my 18 month old daughter.  So these bibs have been in constant use since November of 2009, well over 3 years, and still look great...colors are still bright, terrycloth hasn't pilled, waterproof layer between the terry layers is still fully intact, and they come out of the dryer essentially flat (not curled from the low heat).  Velcro still super sticky.  I haven't had to throw a SINGLE ONE out...really amazing.  I'm pleasantly shocked at how well they've held up!",5
"Munchkin Arm and Hammer Nursery Fresheners, 5 Pack, Lavender or Citrus","I thought these worked great.  We use a Diaper Dekor Plus but with our child being 1yr old, the diapers get a little stinky.  We put two in her diaper pail and they instantly cleared up the smell.  We have had them in there for about 3 weeks and the room still smells fresh.  I would not say the room has the smell of the sent in these, but that didn't matter to us.  My only issue is that when you want one, you have to open the entire package.  I had to tape the rest of the package so the scent stayed in the containers.  That's my only reason for not giving it 5 stars",4
Zoli Baby On-the-Go Snack/Formula Dispsenser - 2 oz,"I never used this for formula - I used it for food once my little girl was eating solids. It is a GREAT versatile product - use 1 or all 4 compartments, depending on what you need. We put puffs in the top and fruit, veggies, cheese, etc. in the containers below. Never had a problem with this leaking. It even fits nicely in my SkipHop cooler so it is easy to take this along for a day trip!!",5

He some what drank out of Dr Brown's bottles, but he drank out of this bottle with no problem. Dr Brown's bottles he would only drink about 1 1/2 ounces before he would start to reject it. With Nuby, he drinks 4-5 ounces with no problem! Bought it at Babies r us for 10 bucks.",5
"EveryDay Willow Wool Dryer Balls Gift Set of 3, Natural","I bought a set and started using them in January.  One ball unraveled after about 6 months of use.  I hoped it was a fluke and was willing to give the manufacturer the benefit the doubt.  The second one unraveled in August, leaving little wool fuzzies all over an entire load of clothes.  I spent over an hour pulling them off of everything in that load of laundry.  The third one is still hanging on, but I am sure it is only a matter of time before it bites the dust.",1
"Tivoli Couture Mommy's Hug Baby Carrier Cover and Wearable Blanket, La","summary: I gave it 4 stars, because it is easy to use, easy to adapt and it will protect my kid. Would have given 5 stars if it was zipper instead of elastic (less air in)and if had a removable cushion insert to use for winter (but who can beat this price???)Full: The product look exactly like you see on the picture (it is not really metallic). It is wind/rain proof with a removable hood and it has a soft plush lining inside. It works great for my baby bjorn, it does not interfere with it, and my baby seems not to mind it at all. It is also easy to pack, you can fold it and just put it in your bag when not in use.It has elastic all around it so you can wrap the carrier or the car sit or the stroller, my only problem with it is that it could not cover his arms completely and I had to adjust it to make sure he would not get wet or cold (it is basically a bag with elastic). You still have to put him in warm clothes and you can even have a blanket around him (the mommy's hug cover will secure it). It is not made for winter though, as promptly explained by Tivoli's team to me when I emailed then (apparently they will make the winter version available in October).",4

"Gift Mark Round Children table, Natural","The first table sent to me was obviously a returned product and the packaging looked like it had been run over by a truck.  Once I got the second table I was very happy with my purchase.  The table is sturdy and made of solid wood.  It is really a great table for the price.  I wanted a white one, but the low price of this ""natural"" finish persuaded me to get this one.  I think I'll just spray paint it a bright color one day if I get tired of the light wood.  Great table!",5
CoCaLo Little Ducky 4-Piece Crib Set,Just my own personal preference.  but when I found out i was having a boy a bit too feminine for him.  Again personal preference.,2

Summer Infant Extra Camera For Deluxe Day and Night Handheld Color Video Monitor Set,I bought this additional camera to go with a set that I already have when I had my 2nd child.  It works perfectly.  I can easily switch between camera 1 and camera 2 with no problem.  The camera is super easy to use and is very clear.  The only downside with this camera set is that it doesn't automatically switch back and forth between camera 1 and 2- you have to manually do it. I keep a 2nd monitor that is just voice activated in my baby room at night so I am sure to hear her if the video monitor is on my first child.  The distance is also great- I have no problem with static on the first floor of my house with the cameras upstairs.,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"I don't think this seller is selling genuine Lamaze toys. Stitching was unravelling around labels and materials just seemed &#34;off&#34; , seemed slightly grubby and not like usual Lamaze toys. will not use as I am worried that unsafe materials were used as my daughter is at the age where everything goes into her mouth.",1
"Skip Hop Set of 2 Zoo Bookends, Dog","I bought these for my baby's nursery. They look cute sitting in the dresser, but they aren't very heavy so a door slamming sometimes knocks them over and down go the books.",3
Boppy Pregnancy Wedge with Cotton Slipcover,I was using a regular pillow to support my growing tummy and I have to say my husband was feeling like there was a great divide between us in bed but without it I could not sleep. With this pillows its small and lifts my tummy up just enough to take off the pressure and my husband can still feel close. I can see me still being able to use it after the baby just to lay on as well.,5

The First Years Compass Premier Folding Adjustable Booster - Pacific,"I'm a bit of a car seat freak for kids. When my daughter was too big for regular car seats and needed to graduate to a booster, I initially bought her a backless wlittle one. That wasn't horrible but I could see that she wasn't really comfortable and downright miserable on longer trips. This seat was recommended to me by a good friend. My daughter loves it. Loves the cupholders. Loves that it's roomy. It folds in half t easily leave at school for after class playdates.",5
"Munchkin Nursery Projector and Sound System, White","This is my 4th sound/projector machine and they are all junk. Usually the projector is the first to go, on this one it was the sound.

Koala Baby Cuddle Plush - Sage Turtle,"I first purchased the blanket 18 months ago for my soon to be born grandson who would have a turtle themed nursery.  18 months later, it is his favorite blanket and the only one he wants to take for nap and bedtime.  Using a &#34;fill in&#34; while this one was being washed was no fun.  Grandma purchased a 2nd and the favorite blanket is always ready!  Good quality and cute.",5
"Tiny Love Gymini Bouncer, Blue/Yellow","After reading several reviews on a variety of bouncing devices for babies, the gymini had the best overall rating. We got it for our one month old and it was wonderful!!! The arms that fold to the side are extremely helpful when you need to pick up or put down your precious baby. In addition, when our baby dirtied the fabric, it was quick and easy to remove the fabric to wash.One thing to note, the gymini requires C batteries and it does not come with the bouncer.",5
Mobi Tykelight GloMate Plus,"So disappointed.  Bought two of these for my two kids last Christmas.  One worked for a couple of days, the other for a couple of weeks.  Troubles began with them getting a little flaky about sitting on the charging base just so, then they just wouldn't charge at all.",1
Evenflo Portable Ultrasaucer,"I bought this for my 4 1/2 month old son and returned it the next day. It is very bright and colorful and that is the only nice thing I can say. The only toy my son would play with was the frog. None of the toys moved, they were not eye catching, you could barely hear the music, and once the batteries die.....that's it. YOU CAN NOT REPLACE THE BATTERIES! This toy is not entertaining.",2
Primo Viaggio SIP,"As with most safety related baby merchandise, we purchased our Primo Viaggio based on its excellent review in Consumer Reports.  My guess is that the folks at CR never tested the seat with an actual baby in it.  Our 3 month old cried constantly whenever we put him in this seat.  Normally he is a very happy, mellow kid.  He is always smiling and happy. But as soon as we put him in this seat, he begins to fuss and by the time we are pulling out of the driveway he is in full wail.  For the first couple of months, we didn't even think to attribute it to the car seat.  My wife would even put off or completely avoid trips in the car because she felt so bad about how uncomfortable he felt.  We happened to have an extra, unused, Graco car seat laying around and one day we decided to give it a try to see if it made any difference.  WOW!!!.  It was like night and day.  We put him in that seat and he smiled away. I should also mention that the Graco seems to weigh about half as much as the Primo.  Now car trips are filled with the pleasant sounds of his happy burbles instead of the anguished cries we heard while he was in the Peg Perego.",2
"JJ Cole Satchel Diaper Bag, Green Arbor",I can't say how this bag will hold up since I haven't started using it yet but I love the look of the bag! It feels more like a purse than you're standard diaper bag. The inside is a nice lime green so it is perfect for carrying around with our baby boy! It seems very well made and I hope it will hold up well!,5
"Fisher-Price i-Glide Cradle 'n Swing, Green","We recieved the swing as a gift for our first child, and we LOVE it! Easy to assemble and easy to work! I am sure our baby will love it!! I love the fact you have the choice to rotate, and also have it glide or swing, but most of all the plug in feature is what sold us! Along with the green! We love the color green and this is just the perfect swing!",5
"Carters Keep Me Close Blanket, Ecru",This blanket is unbelievably SOFT.  I ordered it for my 3 month old great-grandson. He also loves it. He will hold it against his face as he goes to sleep.  I would recommend this blanket for any tiny baby. Once again Amazon has hit a home run!,5
"The First Year's Infant To Toddler Tub with Sling, Blue",Everytime I give my son a bath the rough sides of this tub rub the skin off of his little toes causing them to bleed terribly bad. And since you cant keep a baby from kicking his feet I would suggest a different tub.,1
5 Pack Receiving Blankets in Pink Assortment,"These Gerber receiving blankets are soft, generously sized, and well-made.  They stand up well to allot of washings and still retain their size and color.  I recommend this brand.- It is now 8 months later.  These blankets still look good and have held up well.",5
"The First Years Insulated Sippy Cup, John Deere",I love it because it does not leak.  I love it because my child does not try to unscrew it.  We tried the toss away sippy cups but my child like to flip the lids off.  This was a wonderful switch for us.,5
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I didnt realize just how many problems this bath actually had before I bough it. The water wont stay in the bath. I dont care what method you use its impossible to keep the water from leaking, or actually pouring , out. As far as it fitting in the sink I dont know what kind of sink it would fit in , but definately not mine. So basically its useless....",1
WubbaNub (tm) DRAGON Pacifier!,"This really helped my son keep a hold of his binky.  Overall less fussing from it falling out and less having to run to the sink while he screams because it fell on the floor.  Plus, he just loves it.  The lamb, monkey, and puppy are also great.",5

Jellystone Necklace - Silicone (Teething/Nursing) (Stormy Grey),"Keeps baby entertained, looks nice, easy to clean, does not get stuck on neck hair like chew beads do.  Expensive but worth it.  I'd buy other colours if they were cheaper, but luckily grey goes with everything!",5

"Britax Frontier 90 Booster Car Seat, Zebra","This cars seat's unique design for attaching to your car is great, quick and easy, and it really holds tighter to the seat than any other car seat I have owned.",5
"Leachco Snoogle Mini Compact Side Sleeper, Sage/White dot","I read as many reviews as I could about this and similar pregnancy pillows. I finally settled on this one because of the price and size (I'm only 5'0""). Unfortunately, it's actually *too* small for me. I use it in most of the ways illustrated on the instruction card it comes with. I just don't use it along my back or stomach when I'm sleep on my side. Also, the pillow is well insulated, which can be bad or good depending on where you live. Here in FL, it can make for an uncomfortably warm night, even with A/C and a ceiling fan. All in all, a serviceable product, but not what I had been hoping for.",3
Dr. Brown's Milk Storage Bags,"I love that these bags have two seal zip strips, so no leaking before they've frozen in your freezer.  These are the only kind I will buy from now on!",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"The sounds, the feel...it's a great toy for a baby learning about her senses.  What a nifty little toy that does so much for a young mind.  I may buy this toy, along with my other gift(s), every time I attend a baby shower because it's so helpful in a baby's development.",5
CoCaLo Sugar Plum Sherpa Blanket,I purchased this blanket as an addition to the cocalo sugar plum collection we already had. It was a perfect addition and my baby girl love it as an object she want to hold while on the swing. I am satisfied overall.,5
bumGenius One-Size Snap Closure Cloth Diaper 4.0 - Bubble,"Warning: long review!Short version:Pros:*fit well*wear well*cute colors*very absorbent!*convenient and easy for inexperience cloth diaperers (baby sitters, daycares, and dads :))Cons:*bulkyWe tried a few kinds of cloth diapers before finally deciding that bumGenius was best for us. We have not had a single leak since starting to use them and they fit great. I disagree with their sizing chart on where to place the snaps for size because it fits our daughter unsnapped and she is 20 lbs right now, but it still also fits our toddler (who is potty training and will be switching to them soon for overnights instead of a Pull-Up). I find this to be a minor issue that does not affect their quality.Personally I prefer the snaps. Some people say that they think the snaps are more difficult to put on while changing a wiggly baby, but that has not been my experience. Our daughter is EXTREMELY wiggly, with most changings starting with an arched back and ending in much tears and screaming. (I'm not really sure why she hates it so much-- perhaps it's the fact that she is being forced to lay down against her will.) Anyway, once you know which snaps fit for your baby, just keep that in mind and snap it in the same spot every time. I think the velcro on the hook and loop is a bit odd because the strip across the front is twice as wide as the side velcro tabs. Not sure why this is. We happen to have both because when I went to a local cloth diaper store they didn't have as wide of a variety of colors in the snaps and they had the buy 5 get 1 free deal running and I wanted to get enough to get the sale. If you are deciding whether to go with snaps or hook and loop, here is an argument for the hook and loop: as far as pocket diapers go, the laundry tabs work great. I often forget to put the velcro on the laundry tabs and 7 times out of 10 it happens to velcro itself to the laundry tab. I would advise to not forget though as it tends to leave some nasty marks on the inserts if they aren't properly adhered. Happy Heineys laundry tabs DID NOT WORK when I properly applied them 8 out of 10 times! Fuzzibunz snaps are very awkward to snap IMHO because of the 3 snaps not being lined up nicely.As far as convenience goes, I think the bumG's are great. I stuff them after they are laundered and then put them on as needed. If I'm using them for overnight, I quick stuff the newborn insert in and then put the diaper on. The best part is that both the full-size and newborn inserts come with it, unlike some other brands. When they're wet just pull out the insert and toss both in the wet bag and zip-up! I have heard some people complain that the pocket part, which is similar to a pillow case, can get all full of poop and that makes it gross to pull out when it is dirty, thankfully I have not had that problem at all and I think if I did, I would probably use a wipe to grab it out instead of my hand. Some other pocket diapers have the insert slip in through the back, but I find this a little weird because there is nothing to hold the insert from sliding out except for the pressure of the diaper being on. My Happy Heiney's and Fuzzibunz had the inserts sticking out a little bit all the time because there wasn't the extra fabric in the back to hold it in nicely as with the bumG's.I have been washing our bumG's in Charlie's liquid soap regularly and then Oxyclean once per week to eat the odor (recommended to me by a cloth diaper veteran) and we have had no leak, repellant, or buildup issues thus far. The bumG's also dry really quickly, which is nice. I only dried them in the dryer the first time after I washed them and every other time I have hand dried them. We live in an apartment, so I don't want to pay the extra money for the dryer. I'm cheap, what can I say? They only take a few hours to dry and the inserts take longer than the diaper part. I have also heard that they last longer when air dried.I also love all of the colors that bumG's come in! They are so cute and fashionable! I have all of them (including Albert and Lovelace, which are not pictured) except Sassy, which is a little bright for me. They all work equally great!One downside, if you care, is that they are a little bulky. We have had to go up a size in pants for our daughter, but it doesn't bother me too much. In the summer, it's so hot somedays I don't bother with pants anyway. The diapers are so dang cute!Comments? Questions? I will gladly respond to other users who have more questions in the comment section, in case I missed anything.",5
"Gerber Graduates BPA Free 2 Pack Fun Grips spill Proof Cup, 10 Ounce, Colors May Vary","Our boys drink a lot! These have been great! easy to clean. We've had six of them over the years. First got &#34;Tommee Tippee&#8217;s soft-spout Explora&#34; because we thought the soft spout would be gentle for our infant. It sucked. The thing leaked badly and tore when trying to clean it. the Gerber Nuk Sippy has handles and is nice for when they first learn to hold a cup, but after that it's about hydrating your kid without getting liquids all over your home. These perform!",5
Booginhead SippiGrip - Blue,"I purchased this at ""big name baby store"" for $5.99, then had an additional coupon so it was even less... So I definitely wouldn't make this purchase here.But I love this so far! My son just turned 1, and he received a small, lightweight umbrella stroller (Maclaren Volo) for quick trips/public transportation. The seat is much smaller (obviously) then his full size stroller he was used to, so when he'd drop his sippy it was falling to the ground instead of the seat. We use stainless steel sippys & I didn't want them getting all dented/scratched so I went to pick up one of these ASAP. I'm not usually a fan of Velcro, but this seems to be pretty strong & secure. The grippy end stays securely on the cup without slipping. My son is not bothered by it being hooked onto his 5 point harness, & drinks from the cup without any difficulty. I like that it serves its purpose and keeps his sippy off the dirty ground. Hopefully he doesn't figure out the Velcro for a little while longer...",5
"timi &amp; leslie Hart Diaper Bag, Espresso","Oh wow. Where to start? I ordered this through Vine because I thought we could use a nice secondary diaper bag to keep in my car, and I thought it looked pretty masculine. When it arrived, one look at the style and proportions said it definitely wasn't very butch. ""It's a purse,"" my wife said when I modeled it. Take that for what it's worth.That being said, this is the most thorough diaper bag I've seen yet. There are no less than four zippered pockets on the front, a pad for changing your baby on, a leather purse of some sort, a bottle insulator, and a few leather straps whose purpose isn't readily apparent, at least to me. So if you properly stock this, you'll be able to handle just about any baby-changing or baby care situation that life can throw at you.One caveat: when I got this in the mail, every cubic inch of volume in this this was either stuffed or wrapped with paper and/or plastic, and sometimes both. It seems like a really petty thing that gripe about, and I know that they ship it that way so it maintains its shape, but it was a minor annoyance to unstuff, snip, and remove everything.If you want something that's more stylish leather than rugged manly leather, go for it.",4
"Regalo Easy Step Walk Thru Gate, White","I was looking for a not so expensive doggie gate that would keep my pup out of harms way when I was gone. First gate I bought, and I won't be buying any other brands in the future! It's inexpensive and comes with all of the features any dog owner would need. I know this is suppose to be for children, but hey my pup IS my child! It has an easy open latch, much better than the gates you have to step over. Took me all of ten minutes to put together, very easy and great insturctions! I didn't mount it to my wall. It's very sturdy and does it's job well. I love it!",5

Little Taggies Naturals 100% Organic: ALL STYLES! (Blue- Summer Rain),"I had purchased 2 other taggie blankets and expected this to be similar, but was disappointed.

"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;",This item posses a chocking hazzard. I woke up to my 6 month old gagging on the elastic strap that holds the sheet to the crib. While it may seem like a wonderful invention (oh how i miss it!) I don't think it's worth the risk.,1
"Summer Infant Swaddleme MicroFleece Adjustable Infant Wrap, Blue, Small/Medium","A friend loaned us 2 of these swaddlers and at first we thought our newborn daughter didnt like them. She squirmed and cried while we tried to wrap her up. So we tossed them aside. Later we watched ""the happiest baby on the block"" DVD (which I highly recommended) and realized that swaddling was step 1 of the multi step process of calming your child. Now we swaddle up the baby then add pacifer, vacuum cleaner noise, jiggling or putting her on her side (and sometimes all of the above) and she falls asleep in record time. We even swaddle her and put her in the swing and she will sleep up to 4 hours which is delightful. SURE, you can swaddle a child with most decent sized square blankets made out of a stretchy material so you dont neccisarly NEED this. BUT, at 3am, this swaddler simplifies the process. 3 pieces of Velcro and you're back to sleep. love it.",5
"Jeep Cherokee Sport Stroller, Brick Red","For the price this is a great stroller.  Couple of items that I wasn't aware of until I got it home - the sun shield is manual, the stroller itself is very, very light weight, and the back of seat is controlled by a strap which is kind of a pain.  It also seemed a bit low.  I'm only 5'4&#34; and I felt the handle could be a bit higher.  As for the weight, I felt it might tip over easy, but so far it has been okay.  Again I think for the price it's fine and easy to handle - great as a grandma stroller which is what I'm using it as.  I would recommend a heavier stroller for an everyday stroller.",3

"Britax Marathon 70-G3 Convertible Car Seat, Onyx","This is the third Britax Marathon we've owned, and so I've really gotten to see the product evolve.  My wife selected the Britax Marathon three years ago for our first child because it was one of the safest seats around.  Then we got one for the other car, and now we need one for our 7 month old.  They're expensive, but given that kids are in car seats for 5+ years, I think of it as an investment.This one is much easier to set up than in years past, and there has been a great improvement in how you adjust the shoulder straps as the child grows taller.  The oldest one, you basically have to remove it and take it apart.  Then they had some clunky knob on the side.  Now, you just grab a handle above the child's head and pull.  That's it!There's also a very nice feature with a crotch pad over the buckle.  I was always worried that just a buckle was sometimes uncomfortable.This works for just about ever type of connection you can find, but we have it in our car with a LATCH.  This thing is too heavy to lug around in airports, so for travel we have aCosco High Back Booster.  It's much smaller and lighter than a Marathon.  If you've never had one before, they are BIG.  Safety takes up space.The onyx styling is very elegant, and would look great in a black car with black leather seats.  For me, I'm still a fan of theCowmooflage.[Update Sep 27, 2012] After using the Cosco seat, I have an increased appreciation for the LATCH connectors on the Britax!  The Britax ones are so much easier to get on and off.",5

Philips Avent Express Baby Food and Bottle Warmer,"This warmer does the job, but you should be careful not to forget and leave the milk in it longer than it has to(unfotunatelly there is not timer or allarm), because it gets HOT in no time.

Aden and Anais UpAwaySwddleBlnkts,"I love these blankets.  I have a set of the other aden and anais swaddlers, the type that are white with random owls/bumblebees, etc.  I got these as a second set.  The muslin swaddles in general are great blankets because they are light weight and breathable.  They are big enough to make a nice tight swaddle.  You can also fold them into smaller squares for more layers and warmth.  These are also big enough to drape over yourself to use as an improptu nursing cover.I like these brightly colored blankets better because you can throw them over the carseat, stroller, or rock and play and it will block out some of the light to help with naps.  I have also draped them over my shoulders with the baby in the carrier to block light-as an added bonus it looks like I am wearing a nice shawl or scarf.",5
"Pikibu I-See-You Car Family Mirror, Black","I love this mirror! I can see all three of my kids in my Honda Odyssey. It has changed car rides for our family. For example, today I was about to snap at my son. My daughter was whining and he was making a ruckus so I assumed he was bothering her again. I glanced in my new mirror and quickly realized she was irritated with her car seat straps and my son was just being a noisy boy. I am so glad I know what is going on now. This mirror is great!!

Cozy Car Seat Microfiber and Fleece Cover- Pink,"I bought two of these fleece covers (gray and tan) for my twins who were born in January. As we live in the Midwest I knew we needed something to keep them warm during transporting, and these definitely do the trick. The covers have a quality, micro-suede cover that is lined with thick, faux wool. I really like how there is a bit of velcro above the face flap to hold the flap open, when needed. Also, the zipper opening allows you to put baby in/take her out without removing the whole thing. I have Graco Snugride 35's (which are a little larger than most infant car seats) and the covers fit quite well. I would definitely recommend this product, especially for the price!",5

Baby Einstein Around The World Discovery Center,"We have a small house so I had resisted getting an exersaucer when our little guy was big enough for one.  But after seeing how much fun he had in the ones at school, I wanted to give him the option for playing in one on the weekends.  I was concerned that we'd only use it for a couple of months as he was already 28 inches, but said what the heck.  Got it, easy to put together, and was delighted to find that on the low setting he is almost flat footed, but at the middle setting he is barely on his tiptoes.  I have no worries that he will be able to use this until he grows out of it or is walking.  It's a very busy center, but he is old enough that it's not overwhelming.  Without the stabilizers he can get some nice rocking and rolling but it is nowhere near tipping it over.We have only had it a few days so can't say how well the toys wear but if there are any concerns will be sure to come back and report!",5
"Britax Frontier 90 Booster Car Seat, Zebra","This car seat is phenomenal. From the ease of instillation to the safety ratings it's one of my best purchases of the year, and i've made many.I needed a car seat for my 2.5 year old toddler who weighs 36 pounds and is 39&#34; tall. I have the marathon which i do love but I put my 4 month old in it because he couldn't stand his bucket seat. I honestly feel like I am strapping my child into a fighter jet when I put her in the car seat, it is so sturdy and safe, doesn't move a .001cm when tugged. The click tight system was so easy I actually laughed out loud when I put it in the car. The black is great, I also bought the beige (already stained).The safety ratings are great but there was the whole IIHS rating that I was worried about. I called Britax to ask if it was appropriate for my 2.5 year old and inquire about the IIHS. It was a great option for my daughter as she hit the height and weight requirements and it will last until she is done with car seats.  As for the IIHS, they said it is not likely to happen and will only happen on some makes and models of cars.  If it does the belt will hit the child in the belly region instead of on the upper thigh. If it does, just call them and they will send a fix for the system. It's not a safety issue unless installed wrong, like all car seats a seat is only as safe as the correct instillation. This is by far a recommendation I will make to friends. I've already bought 3 for my family. Plus Amazon has them cheaper than anywhere out there.",5
"Pearhead Babyprints Keepsake, Year-Round","From crazzeto's wife:I really wish I had read the amazon reviews before I bought this. This was our baby's first Christmas and we had intended to give cute keepsake ornaments of her tiny hand to her grandparents so we bought two of these packs. When I opened them, the first surprise was that they didn't come with modeling clay as I had anticipated but instead came with a lump of some sort of sticky, lightweight marshmallow foam. The second surprise was that the ""shaping tool"" was not a circular cookie-cutter but was really just a long, thin piece of flimsy plastic you were supposed to form into a circle on your own and use to shape your foam into a cicle. Unfortunately, it is absolutely impossible to shape it into a decent circle - it is literally impossible to do it. You'll end up with a lumpy, mishappen sort-of circle. Very disapointing. The biggest and worst surprise is that the marshmallow foam NEVER fully dries. Your keesake ornament will always be somewhat soft and forever at the mercy of anything that touches it because even the slightest touch will cause a dent or scratch. Hardly the sort of material you want to make an heirloom out of. Please, do yourself a favor and do NOT buy this. I am very upset that I missed out on the opportunity to commemorate my baby's first Christmas and I hope no one reading this has to go through that too.",1
"The First Year's Infant To Toddler Tub with Sling, Blue","Unquestionably the best bathtub to keep your little baby secure while you use both hands to bathe him.  I was so nervous to give my baby a bath by myself, but after we went and bought this tub, I've never been more confident about it.  The hammock makes him feel very secure.  Great product!",5
"Thirsties Diaper Cover, Celery, X-Small (6-12 lbs)","My husband and I LOVE the Thirstie Diaper covers we bought for our daughter. They are durable, easy to use and come in a wonderful variety of colors! They need to be washed about once a week (barring any diaper ""overflow"") - which seems to be better than the continual washings the AIOs tend to require. The only hang up we had with them is that at first we didn't think to make sure that the diaper was fully tucked into the leg holes but that is more user error than anything else. We are ordering the next size and are looking forward to another 3 months of no hassle cloth diapering!",5
"OXO Tot Feeding Spoon Set, Green",I love the depth of these spoons and the grip on them.  Love the fact that the spoon is also rubber so my babies could chew on them when they were first starting solid foods.  These spoons are WAY better than those Munchin spoons!,5
Exergen Temporal Artery Thermometer MODEL# TAT-2000C,"Purchased this with a $5 mail in rebate. The rebate check bounced, so I'm out the $5 plus a $25 returned check fee. I suggest passing on this item and buying something from a real company.",1
"The First Years Jet Stroller, Red/Black","this is the best we've had - we used kolkraft, graco, even flo, and a couple of others.  We've had umbrella strollers, stroller system, tandem joggers, buggies...this is the best for the price and the practical usage.  it's light but sturdy; the wheels move easily; it was already assembled and it seems comfortable and it's not too short",5
The Toy Workshop Wooden Fairy Letter - K,It was allot smaller than anticipated especially considering the price. Other than that it was adorable. Buyers pay attention to the dimensions.,3
Safety 1St Comfy Cushy 3-in-1 Potty,"The cushion is super soft.  Its incredibly pliable while maintaining its shape and not damaging the blue foam cover.The seat itself snaps into the potty so the child cannot slide all over the place and fall off the toilet. (Speaking from prior experience.)The shield works for both girls and boys.The stool is sturdy for standing.  Only con for me - the rubber feet don't stay on very well.  We put a fluffy, rubber bottomed rug under it to keep it from sliding.Most of the complaints are easy to remedy.  The foam seat does absorb a little bit of urine and can begin to smell.  Fill the kitchen sink with a mixture of dishsoap and water and squeeze the cushion all the way around to clean it out.  If you do this regularly, it will not smell.Note - the foam is yellow inside.  So all the yellow coming out is not urine - its the color in the foam.If it does begin to smell, use a mixture of vinegar and water.Boys do need to be taught to ""tuck"" themselves into the shield.  Is this really a problem?  This seems second nature to my barely-three-year-old by now.The hole is not really THAT small.  My 3 year old is in the 95th percentile in height for 4 year olds, and 95th percentile in weight for 3 year olds, and he's been able to successfully use this potty for over 10 mos now.No matter what potty you use, it will not be a mess free experience.  That is not the potty's fault.  It's part of the process of learning how to use the toilet, while having little coordination.",5
"Warner Brothers Icon Chair, Batgirl",We just bought this chair for our daughter and we love it. She loves the colors of it. She loves super heros but its hard to find them that are in girly colors. This chair worked perfectly and she loves it.,5

"Mud Pie Back Pack, Owl",very durable and easy to clean.  great bag for transitioning from a big baby bag to something that just carries the essentials.,5
Yookidoo Crawl N' Go Snail,"We bought this for our son when he was beginning to crawl. We hoped it would encourage him. Unfortunately, when we brought it home we realized the wheels being hard plastic slipped on our carpet and would not catch to propel the snail forward. With a lucky brainstorm a couple weeks later, I found some of those rubber bracelets that could serve as ""tires."" It never really worked as a crawling incentive. He played with the rings, he really likes the ring that rattles. Now that he is walking, he likes the snail more he likes to pick it up and carry it by the tail. I personally think the music is too loud. I wish it had a softer setting and I really wish it had an off button. Every time we pick up his toys and put them in the box the music goes off. Maybe because it is one of the few ""music"" toys we have but even the funky music gets to me after awhile. Overall, it is still a sturdy toy. The batteries have lasted and our son has dropped it multiple times. I like the design and colors, because it's just a little different from everything else. On sale its a good buy if you don't have wall-to-wall carpet.",3
American Baby Company Celery Stripe 100% Cotton Percale Crib Sheet,"This sheet is very pretty but the material is super scratchy, even after mulitple washes.  I would expect a crib sheet to be softer from the strart.",3
Flip Potty Trainer Kit 1 trainer + 3 organic cotton pads Sassy / Butternut,"I bought a bunch of Alva training pants but they gave my daughter rashes on her legs, leaked and were super difficult to get on and off when she pooped without making a huge mess down her legs (gross!). She's 2 and is having a hard time being potty trained so I decided to try one of these. She's still having a lot of accidents so I needed something with snaps to easily remove it when she poops. The side tabs are stretchy making it easy to pull up and down. The inside has velcro to hold the inserts in place which makes it easier to pull on and off. It also has laundry tabs to keep it from sticking to everything in the wash. I've had no problems with the snaps coming undone when I pull these up and down. She's worn these day and night and we haven't had a single leak. I LOVE the organic cotton inserts and wish they made these for the regular Flip covers! Soooooooo much better than microfiber! I like it so much I bought 2 more sets and will buy 1-2 more. 3 sets (3 covers, 9 inserts) but I like having plenty of diapers on hand. I've already recommended these to my friends and family whether they cloth diaper or not.",5
Munchkin White Hot Inflatable Duck Tub,"This has been the best thing ever to bathe my girls. (14 mos & 3yrs) I have had the same duck for over 2 years with absolutely no problems. I don't know what some are talking about when they say how hard it is to fill, wash and rinse your kid. I have been able to do all of the above with ease using a plastic bowl. I first use it to fill the tub and then I fill it with water and set it aside. After my baby is washed and done playing I have them stand up, I pour clean, warm water over them and scoop them up with a big, fluffy towel. How is that hard? Please, even my husband agrees that this is the easiest way to bathe the girls while they are small. He NEVER did it until I bought this! My oldest is 3 and although she can take a bath in the big tub, she still enjoys the duck because she says she can ""relax at the spa"", she means leans back on the sides with her legs hanging over. ;-) My youngest loves it and I can actually spruce up the bathroom while she plays in the tub. I never leave her alone but I don't have to keep holding on to her. This tub has made bathtime the absolute, hands-down easiest time of the day. Never any arguments when they here ""bathtime"", in fact, it was the only thing that would soothe them when they were fussy.Now as far as clean-up. Also a breeze. Just unplug drain while you are rinsing your kid. let drain while you are dressing them. When you go back in the bathroom to hang the towels, just rinse tub with plastic bowl filled with clean, hot water. Flip it upside down. Go read your babies their bedtime stories and when you're done make a pitstop in the bathroom to stick it to the wall or hang it on a hook with the loop that is attached. Easy-peasy! You have clean, happy kids and a clean tub ready for tomorrow night. Life is good...",5
The Door Guardian Childproofing Lock Colors: White,I couldn't figure out by the picture how this lock worked and just went by the awesome ratings.  My 6 year old is becoming quite the escape artist and this definitely keeps her in from opening the front door.  It works great. My husband did notch out the molding some to install this but it looks great. Our door and molding are both white so we got the white lock and it looks really nice. It seems like a heavy duty lock and easy enough for my 12 & 14yr old to open but up so my 6 year old can't reach it.,5
"Body Shaper Shapewear Fajas Colombianas body4052 (S, Nude)",First off when i ordered this it had a different picture of how it REALLY looked.

TUPPERWARE Shape O Ball Toy,"The first one I bought for my son, now almost thirty five.  The second one I bought for my daughter, now twenty six.  The third one I bought for my grandson, now almost twelve.  Now I have bought the fourth for my granddaughter, now almost one.  Great to find they still are made, great fun with kids.",5
Baby Trend Single Snap N' Go Stroller,No ndeed to wake baby from car seat to get into stroller.  Just pick the car seat out of car and place in this infant seat carrier / stroller frame.  GREAT invention.  Received as a shower gift and it was greatly appreciated and used often!,5
WubbaNub Lamb,"I had another pacifier, but I don't know what happened to it. With this one all you need is to find the lamb and you're set. Baby loves it, and as soon as she is old enough to grab she won't cry when it fall off her mouth. Awesome buy.",5
"Boon Odd Ducks 4 Pack,Pink Multi","I thought these duckies were super cute. I would have loved them but the decorative paint came off on my sweet girl. I saw orange streaks on her hand and thigh, I scrubbed but it would not come off. At first I could not figure out where it was coming from, then I looked at that &#34;odd&#34; duck and the orange paint was running. I thought this may be a fluke so I took that one out and continued to use the others. White paint came off on her the next time I gave her a bath. I contacted the company and thy offered to replace if I sent in pictures.",1
Manhattan Toy Dress Up Princess,This is a really cute toy. Just the right size for my grandson's little hands.  Well worth the money and delivered promptly.,4
Sesame Street Framed Friends Green Folding Travel Potty Seat,"I bought this for a trip back in 2005. My daughter was still potty training and coming along quite well. She was wearing regular underwear during the day and pull ups at night. When we made plans to visit family in another state I decided to look for a travel potty seat to pack along with me so she could keep wearing underwear while on the trip. I found this at my local Babies R Us and happily picked it up. When I brought it home, I showed it to her and she was very excited. That excitement was short lived.From the first use this thing was a failure. It didn't fit onto the toilets in the public restrooms (it advertises that it fits all toilets). My daughter nearly fell in, and got scared. She wanted nothing to do with toilets so I had to put her in a pull up (taking an unwanted step backwards in her potty training). When we arrived at my aunt's house, I tried the potty seat on their toilet (which is shaped differently than the public toilets at rest stops). Again, it didn't fit. It slid around and my daughter nearly peed herself trying NOT to get on it. I ended up having to buy more pull ups for the remainder of our trip.When we returned home, my daughter was still skittish about going potty, even on her training potty. It took us weeks to get her back on track. I immediately returned the product and found a padded seat that didn't fold. My daughter hated this thing, and so did I.  I don't recommend this in the least.",1
BRICA Seat Guardian Car Seat Protector,"This is okay, but the base hangs over the seat of my bucket seat by a few inches (I have an Acadia). We use it for an infant seat, and it works good for that. However, probably wouldn't work good for toddler seats.",3
"Bright Starts Bounce Bounce Baby Activity Zone, Pink",Space-saving design compared to other bouncers is the best feature of this item.  I have attached other toys to the rings to keep my daughter entertained.  Great item!,4
Boutique Brand New GEENNY Pink Butterfly 13PCS Baby Nursery CRIB BEDDING SET,"BEAUTIFUL ! I WAS THRILLED .... This is so pretty.I was impressed that the chocolate brown on the bedding and window valance is kinda like a suede material.It is not cheap looking or made cheap at all - it is VERY NICE.It is GREAT QUALITY ... Everything, every item is so cute !!!!I cant wait for my little girl to get here to fill her room ~ she is the only missing part :o)",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Open-Top Cradle Swing,My daughter loves this swing. It is worth every penny. The swing has been a life saver on many occasions. We love that you have the option to plug it in or to use batteries. It does take up a bit of space but we opted for this one over the travel size swing. The swing offers several music selections and diffent levels of power on the swinging motion. Overall a great product. Our daughter is 6 months and still loves it.,5
"Summer Infant Mother's Touch Large Comfort Bather, Bubble Fish",I have been using this bather since we brought our baby home. I fill the tub with a couple inches of water - to below the seat bottom - and use a washcloth to clean the baby. I use this 3-4 times / week and simply let it air dry afterwards. I have had no problems with mold or mildew. I will probably stop using it once the baby can sit up on her own in the tub.,5
"Summer Infant 3-Stage Superseat Highchair, Green","i like how easy it was to put together. i like the colors. i like the durability of the items on the tray. i like the quality of the orange foam seat. i like how easy it is to clean. i like what little space it takes up.i don't like how rotating/turning the tray is not smooth. it not only takes two hands but you have to be careful of where the baby's knees and hands are. it actually takes some strength to rotate it, i guess i just thought it would be smoother.i don't like how the 4 rubber 'thingys' that are supposed to help keep this from sliding when on a table do not stay in place. whenever i pick it up one or two of the rubber things come off. oh well.this is definitely not meant for a chubbier baby.",4
Tommee Tippee BPA Free Section Plates - 2 Pack (PINK),"I have always used Tommee Tippee products.  Whenever my daughter started a new stage, I started by seeing what Tommee Tippe had first and then went from there.  For the most part, Tommee Tippee's products are superior.  These plates are no exception.  They are divided and can go in the diswasher, microwave and freezer.  They are perfect with the suction mat.  Which is nice because when you buy plates that each have suction devices, it makes the plates more expensive.  This way, you get the suction for all plates (and bowls) without having to spend a fortune.  As I said, it would be nice if the plates has lids, like the bowls do since my daughter's appetite seems to change day to day sometimes and there are times when she barely eats anything.  But this isnt a deal-breaker since most divided plates don't have this.",4
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"This is a great potty seat.  My son always wants to do things like ""big people"" do, so he didn't want to use a little potty seat.  He wanted to use the toilet.  This seat allowed him to use the big toilet and was secure and didn't slide around like another seat that we had tried.",5
"Graco Affix Backless Youth Booster Seat with Latch System, Sailor","I upgraded to this booster seat for older child after he got tired of using the multi-use car seat with the shoulder belt and he immediately liked this more. It provides a great height for him and also has little junk holders. The booster seat also installs very easily and with the flexability of cloth straps for the LATCH system. It also tightens just right with a tug of the front strap, very easy. I  install and remove this seat fairly frequently so I know it is easy as I do not cuss or get annoyed each time I do. I also do not have to place blankets below the booster seat as ti doesn't seem to irritate my leather seats as much as the bulky car seat would. But if you are extra cautious I'd still say to put a little padding under the seat.My only real reason for a 4/5 instead of a 5/5 is because I do think the booster seat could use a tad more foaming for his little bottom. But for the price this was very close to being just right for me. I have always felt I'd rather pay more attention to make sure the vehicle itself has extremely good safety rating and that my driving is safe and defensive rather than drop a bundle of cash on a booster seat. I could have paid about $200 dollars for the booster seat Id have liked, but realized that was ridiculous. This does the trick, and I can always add a small memory foam pad for him to sit on.",4
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Mortimer the Moose Take Along Toy,Mortimer the Moose is so adorable!  I can't wait for my little to come in December!  Definitely worth the money+ some!,5
"Kid'Sleep My First Alarm Clock, Pink","I recently purchased the ""My First Alarm Clock"" in blue from a daily deal website. I specifically wanted this clock for the picture portion to help my 2 year old son learn to stay in bed a little longer, as he is an early riser. Upon plugging in the clock, the picture did not light up as it was supposed to. When I set the clock down, the image flickered on and off. I contacted the deal website company, and the service rep was pleasant and efficient. She passed my info along to the Kid Sleep company, and I was contacted promptly. The woman asked me to try using the clock with batteries to see if that would make a difference. I agreed to try this, even though using batteries would be an extra cost (the instructions state that batteries would have to be replaced monthly). However, the use of batteries didn't make a difference.I contacted the Kid Sleep company to continue to try to solve my problem, but after I left a message, I didn't receive a reply. I called a third time to report my problem and when the woman called me back the next day, she was quite curt and told me that I would have to contact the deal website as she ""couldn't field their service calls"". I'm not sure why this was considered the third party's problem, as there was clearly a defect with the product.Had the clock worked properly, I would have been satisfied. I really wanted to purchase the GroClock, but I wasn't willing to pay $50 for any alarm clock. An improvement to this clock would be a larger, more prominent digital clock, as this portion is quite tiny and hard to see.Due to poor customer service and a defective product, I am NOT impressed, and I would not recommend this product to anyone.",2
"The Original Woombie Baby Cocoon Swaddle (Big Baby (14-19 lbs), Aqua Stripe)","I bought these for my twin when they were about two months old, and they have simplified life tremendously.  It was starting to get really difficult to keep them from getting their hands loose when swaddled in regular blankets, but these are so easy to just zip them up into.  They also really like the fact that they have a little bit of stretch, so they can move around a little bit without startling and waking themselves up.",5
"Baby Jogger City Versa Stroller,  Black","Like many mamas out there, I researched strollers obsessively. Baby Jogger makes quality strollers at an affordable price, so I decided early on I would go with one of their models. However, I waffled between the City Mini GT and City Versa for a very long time. In fact, I ended up ordering booth and returning the City Mini GT. Both are beautiful strollers, it just depends on what you want.I knocked a star off my rating because of the extra weight of the Versa and the fact that it doesn't have all terrain wheels. Those all terrains make for a buttery smooth ride. I did decide to splurge and purchase the $60 Versa GT wheel kit from Baby Jogger's website. The City Mini is lighter by about 6 lbs, and you really do notice the difference. However, the City Mini is not so light weight that you'd want to take it on the subway or travel through an airport with it. At the end of the day, it's still a full-size travel system. So, to me the extra weight of the Versa wasn't a big deal. I'll use a cheap-o umbrella when I really need light weight. This is my stroller for long city walks over bumpy pavement.Both strollers fold equally well. Both seats are nice, but obviously different. The City Mini seems more suited for a toddler. The Versa seems to cradle the baby more and appears more comfortable to me. I think my child would sleep equally well in either, but the positioning of the Versa allows me a better view of him. When the City Mini is reclined, the baby's face is kind of hidden in the back. I also found the recline feature on the City Mini kind of annoying. If you're kid falls asleep while sitting up, it's just more disruptive to recline the seat. In the Versa you kind of just gently lean it back in one motion.Neither stroller will disappoint, but I went with the Versa for two big reasons. (1) I wanted to be able to have my baby face me. I know everyone says that older babies like to face out anyway, but you have the option for him to face either way with the Versa. It just annoyed me to not be able to see him without stopping the stroller and walking around to the front. The reverse facing option was the main selling point for me. And (2) the basket! OMG the Versa is SOOO much bigger than the City Mini. When you're over-analyzing strollers in the store these might sound like minor details, but even walking around my house with the City Mini I was irritated that I couldn't see my son's face and annoyed that I couldn't even fit his (smallish) diaper bag in the basket.After much obsessing and over-analyzing, I'm very very happy with the Versa. Also, for those out there equally obsessing over color - I ended up going with the red, which is a really beautiful rich color and looks gender neutral. My thinking was the same as it is with purchasing luggage. Everyone thinks they want a classic black suitcase, but when you're standing in the baggage claim area and they all look alike, it's nice yours is different enough to stand out.",4
"Skip Hop Bento Diaper Tote Bag, Black","the bag is perfect for my son's stuffs...diapers, small toys, milk, small food and few clothes. the bag is very spacious and very convenient to take anywhere we go.",5
Baby Einstein Take Along Tunes,Bought as a gift for granddaughter. When it arrived we played all the tunes and checked it out in the package.  She loves music so thought she'd love it.  She did enjoy it for the short time we had her here with it. They live out of town so can't say what happened after they left.,5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo,"My daughter is 7 months old, so we are getting a late start on the jumperoo. I wasn't going to purchase one (we already have a play mat, exersaucer, swing, etc.), but she loves jumping on our laps so much I couldn't resist. I purchased this particular jumperoo based on reviews and also my friends' recommendations. We weren't disappointed! It was simple to assemble and my daughter loves it! She jumps, jumps, jumps and yes, has even jumped herself to sleep a couple of times. The music and lights are especially fun. I definitely recommend this purchase, especially if you have an active baby.",5

BABYBJ&Ouml;RN Active Carrier - Black,"We used this carrier until our baby was 8.5 months old - when we finally bought a backpack carrier.

Both my husband and I carried the baby in it, and we had no problems making adjustments to the carrier.  We'll use it again with our next baby.",5
"Fisher-Price Space Saver High Chair, Scatterbug","I purchased this for my 20-month old son.  He was really hating the stand-alone high chair and feeding him was a battle every time.  Now that we have this high chair attached to a chair at our table, we can all eat together and his eating has drastically improved.  Clean-up is easy, but the tray arms kind of get in the way of pulling the chair close to the table.  If your dining table is low like mine you might not be completely happy.",4

Skip Hop Via Messenger Diaper Bag Black,"Echoing what others have said, the mesh looks like it will fray very quickly (and indeed, it has started to on mine) despite hardly using the bag and being very careful with it.That aside, I like the bag.  At first I didn't think it would hold enough, especially since I'm cloth diapering, but it works for several-hour outings.  Longer days out require a whole separate bag.",4

Toby the Turtle Bottle Hugger,"We've used this little guy for quite a while now and I just love it!  It holds up very well when washed on the delicate cycle.  This makes it so easy for a baby to grasp the bottle, while keeping the liquid inside warm.  Every time we're out, someone compliments us on how cute it is.",5
The First Years Learning Curve Floating Stars Teether,"My 8 month old Godson loves this teether. He prefers it over all his other cold teethers. I ordered him extras so one can always be cold and ready. I suggest if your kid likes them as much that you do the same.Never freeze it. They do warm up pretty quickly, I'd say you get about 6-10 minutes of cold teething before it's room temperature, but it also cools down in the fridge again very quickly.It is softer plastic, which seems to be what he prefers, but is sturdy and an hold up to powerful chewing action, teeth, squeezing, being stepped on, and just about any other abuse you can think of.",5

Disana Organic Merino Wool Cover-Natural-86/92 (12-24 mo),This is my favorite wool cover for nighttime. You do have to prep it first by washing and lanolizing a few times. Then it is perfect.

"The First Years Spinning Drying Rack, White",Love this drying rack! Very useful stay right next to my sink and easy accessible for cleaning and making bottles!,5
"Million Dollar Baby Classic Ashbury 4-in-1 Convertible Crib with Toddler Rail, Espresso","**Update: Thanks to the comment from another customer, I was able to get the piece from Million Dollar Baby very easily.  If your crib arrives with a broken piece, you should DEFINITELY go through them instead of calling Amazon.  Amazon still shipped the other crib to me, and then I was not able to have it picked up, so I had to drag it myself to UPS.  90+ lbs is not something I want to be lugging around while pregnant!  However, do call Amazon and they should give you a 20% discount for the damaged item if you choose to keep it.SO FRUSTRATED... I was so excited to open this item.  Opened it up, unpacked it, started assembling it, and about half way through (and over an hours worth of time) I realized that the top rail had splintered and a piece broken off.  I contacted Amazon right away, and was told that the entire crib has to be returned.  They cannot simply replace the broken piece. I asked if I could talk to the manufacturer and the customer service agent explained to me that they would ultimately refer me back to Amazon since the order is fulfilled through them, and I would just be going through more of a hassle. So, now I have to disassemble the crib, repack and somehow fit it back into the box, and then take a day off work so it can be picked up from my house.  Then, the replacement will be shipped of an entire new crib.  All the labor I have already put into and will put into returning the crib is frustrating.  Loosing a day of work is extremely annoying.  Plus, the shipment of the new crib will take a week - whereas when I initially placed the order, it arrived in 2 days.  How is that fair?! Customer service was extremely poor on this and I am now seriously considering removing my online registry from Amazon if this is how problems with orders will be solved in the future.  I will post an update once the item is returned and the replacement has arrived.  I am extremely disappointed with this purchase!",3

"Summer Infant Tiny Diner for Highchairs, Blue","I would recommend this for any parent. Before we had this my son would bump his head on tables when eating out and would chew on the tables (GROSS!). This easily suctions to the table (sometimes a drop of water is needed to help a suction cup stick) and provides a clean place to put my son's finger foods while mommy and daddy eat. The part to catch the food entertains my son and he will flip it up and knock everything out of it, so don't get it just to catch the food babies drop. If we ate out more frequently I would even buy a 2nd one to make sure there was always a clean one available, but we don't eat out often so one is sufficient.UPDATE: I changed my mind about the trough part that catches the food. We were at a restaurant last week where the mat wouldn't stick to the table well, so my son ended up pulling the mat off the table partway through the meal. It didn't fall completely since someone caught it, but all the food that would have dumped on the floor ended up in the trough and therefore wasn't wasted.",5
"Britax 2013 B-Agile Stroller, Granite","The peacock blue color is much darker and less vibrant than I was expecting based upon the photo.  I know every computer monitor is different, but on my monitor it appears a bright cerulean blue;  Upon inspection, I would describe it more as a dark teal.Nonetheless, it is clearly a quality product, and I am very pleased with it. Out of the box, I needed only to attach the wheels, which locked in place with a simple click (no tools needed), connect the canopy and position the fabric in place by lining up the velcro strips, and attach the car seat adapters for use with the Britax B-Safe car seat (not included).  The entire assembly took five minutes, and it was so intuitive I didn't need to refer to the manual.The materials are sturdy and the overall design is well-executed.  The stroller glides effortlessly.So other than the color shock, I am very happy with my purchase.",5
The First Years Take &amp; Toss Spill-Proof Cups - 7 oz - 6 Pk,"I have tried many different sippy cups for my 9 month old. When I found the Take & Toss, I was pleasantly surprised that he took right to it easily. So easily, in fact, that he was using it all by himself while watching TV.He began chewing on the edge with his teeth and all-of-a-sudden- POP!- the lid came off and milk went everywhere. He was covered, terrified at the rush of cold milk all over him, and completely drenched.Oh well, back to the store I go....",3

Tiny Love Super Mat,"I just received this mat for my five month old. We love it! It's so much bigger than I expected, but that's great! Baby loves all the bright colors and activities on the mat. Plus, it gives her a place of her own to play on the floor. The only reason it didn't receive five stars from me is due to the material. My little one is scooting, but the material is very slick. She hasn't been able to scoot around like she likes to do. Other than that, though, this mat is awesome and we highly recommend!",4
Evenflo Embrace Infant Car Seat Base Black,"The installation of the Evenflo Embrace Infant Car Seat Base in our daughter's car heavily taxed my strength and patience. Then, after my brother tried and gave up, my sister-in-law, a nurse, kept saying how important it was to the baby's safety. She and I working together finally got it fastened in and cinched up tight. As a new grandparent I felt compelled to order a second carrier seat base for our van. This installation took much less time and effort. And I did this one alone. Now, the baby rides safely, and the carrier hops from car to van effortlessly. It was worth the effort.",5
Diaper Dekor Plus Diaper Disposal System,"I really don't understand the negative reviews, saying things like ""when you open it, it smells bad!""Uh...of course it smells bad when you open it.  YOU'RE OPENING A CONTAINER OF POOP.  IT'S GOING TO SMELL BAD.Where this product does well, though, is the 99.8% of the time when it is not open.  It contains the odor well.  Only when it gets super-full do you maybe get a whiff that things aren't going well and it's time to change the insert.Unlike the Diaper Genie, this does not use individual plastic bags for each diaper, so it is a little more environmentally friendly.  Of course, that does mean that for the tenth of a second it's open, it might smell a little bit.  But again.  WE'RE TALKING ABOUT POOP.  POOP SMELLS BAD.",4

"Graco Lauren Classic Crib, Espresso","I researched tons of cribs before I decided what to get.  We ordered a DaVinci crib for our house for my older son when he was born in 2010 and got this one for my mom to have at her house for him because it seemed perfect and was half the price.  We've been very happy with both cribs... in fact we're having another baby next month and ordered the Lauren crib for our house for this baby.  It just seemed like a better deal then spending $300 on another crib.  The only disappointing thing when comparing the two is that this crib doesn't have as many height adjustments so the highest level is still somewhat low.  Not a big deal, since when you drop it all the way down it's still very safe... but it was nice to have a really high mattress for those first few months so that I didn't have to bend over so far.  It's a little thing and not worth an extra $150 for me.",5
The First Years Clean Air Diaper Disposal System,"this diaper pail is the most frustrating ever! Let's face it, i don't think odorless is possible but this is far from ""clean air"".  I have to keep changing the battery and the diaper never goes down from the top compartment.I have been through 3 diapers hoping this would be the charm but is just dissappointing.  A regular trash bin is much more effective for me - that's how bad it is.  Please do not buy this product!",1
"Britax Advocate 70 CS Convertible Car Seat, Zebra","My first review was only three stars: First, I have never felt my son was safer than in this Britax car seat with side-impact technology. It looks like he is very comfortable in it as well; however, for the first 3 months he was rear-facing, which made it difficult to get him in and out of the seat. I have to lift him up, dip his head and then lift him up again to rest him into the seat properly. Then, I have to fish out the straps and snaps, which inevitably fall behind him in the seat, to buckle him in properly. He also seems to get a bit overheated in the seat... perhaps from the material or the padding. We will turn him around in two weeks when he turns a year old and may have more positive things to say about the seat then.Three months later, I give it five stars: We have turned him forward facing in the car and he has a lot more room, better view and it is immensely easier to get him in and out of the seat. However, be advised that if you have puffy winter outerwear on your child that it will be a tight squeeze.",5
ThumbGuard LG (7-15 yrs.),"This product (the small) did not work for my dedicated 4 year old thumb sucker. I purchased two, one for each hand, as he is an equal opportunity sucker. We put these on tightly everyday. There were times that I thought that we would cut off his circulation to his hand it was so tight. he figured out how to slip his thumb out by stretching out the band during the night. We also spent a lot of time searching for this as he would hide at least one every day. In addition to being able to pull the thing off, he also chewed on it constantly giving it an oh so lovely smell when we would pull it off to clean it and change the band every night. Frustrating for everyone!",1

Sassy Harmonization Fascination Station Suction Toy,"The level of music is pleasant enough, and it is a cute little song.  The problem I have with it, is it plays the same song, two different versions of it, but still the same song.  Other than that it is pretty good.  For these suction cup toys I just use wipe a little condensation off of my water glass because it doesn't take very much moisture to get them to stick.",1
"Snappi Cloth Diaper Fasteners - Pack of 6 DAYGLO / NEON (2 Orange, 2 Yellow, 2 White)",These are essential when using cloth pre-folds. A lot of people think cloth diapering is hard but these make it simple. I can't say I've ever used pins so I can't compare it to that. My only criticism would be that the white snappi is difficult to see on the white diaper in the middle of the night (dim light on).,5

Peg Perego Aria Light Weight One Hand Fold Stroller in Moka,"At first I thought of buying the Peg Perego Pliko P3, I couldnt push myself getting one because it is pricey at [...] and i am paying for a stroller that mainly made of strong plastic! so I decided on getting something cheaper. I was window shopping at babiesRus.. accidently, i found this 2008 model Aria OH in green bubble on clearance at [...]after sale tax!! what a super bargain!!!What I LOVE:* is pushes smoothly with 1 hand* 1 hand closing and folds compactly* My 9 yr old can lift the stroller without problem, so lightweight at 10lbs!* Large hood and huge peek a poop window* Multiple reclining positionWhat I HATE:* Basket is small, hard to reach* peek a poop is huge but sun goes thru the window* The harness.. freedom of movement is useless.. my 4months old's head was resting of the bucket, so uncomfortable.. I have to roll up a cloth to put on the back of the head* Useless and firmsy parent cupholder* The carseat is hard to attach to the seat, needs practise, alot!i would recommend this stroller to anyone.. but for 2008 model only.. the present model (2009) the safety button is located at the back of the opening button, so it is real hard to press back and below at the same time.. The 2008 model is locate all together.Thoug i may have some dislike about this stroller, but overall i am happy and especially for the price I paid.. I shouldnt be complaining too much! hey is a Peg Perego, where to find a USD95 Peg Perego!",4

Safety 1st Magnetic Locking System Complete,"Difficult to install. Didn't really work with our cabinets, but that is not the product's fault. Most likely user error. The idea is great but I dislike only having 1 key for 8 locks. And to buy another key, you may as well purchase more locks too.",3

I had unfortunately received the wrong one (one that had seams which probably would've been fine too, however, I wanted to have what I ordered), AND, I have to say I received exceptional help from Erin.  The help I received was very efficient, fast, and extremely courteous, and apologetic! I never do reviews, mostly for lack of time.  But I just had to say how wonderful the service was that I got.

I know that droplets of wate will come out of the vent hole, but this one pours.",2
Graco ultraclear baby monitor,"I'm a fan of Graco products in general, and this monitor does not disappoint.  The base is very sensitive, so it transmits even the smallest sounds from your baby's room.  The dual receivers work even when on different floors from the transmitter - in our 3-level, 2,400 sq ft house there's no spot I've found that doesn't get reception.  Best of all, the frequency doesn't cross our phones, computer network or any of our other electronics.  Highly recommended!!",5
4moms Cleanwater Infant Bath Tub with Digital Thermometer,"This tub is not worth the money.  The plastic is cheap, and it is poorly constructed.  Before we even used it once the thermometer fell off as the sticky material was not strong enough to keep it in place.  The idea of the constant running water is good in theory but not very practical - it wastes a lot of water and is hard to adjust the flow of the water to maintain temperature and not flow over the edge.  I eventually got fed up and bought a standard baby tub.",2
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,"We have used this tub for our daughter from birth to now (she is 6 months old). And she was 6 lbs, 14 oz at birth and now is 20 lbs (she's a big baby).  I don't understand the comments about it leaking at the hinges - it's not meant to be that full.  If it was that full it would be dangerous in that if the baby turned their head to the side it would be in the water!  The little reservoir is great at the end to keep ""clean"" water and the plug you can pull anytime is a must.  It fits down in our kitchen sink (and we have used it in other kitchen sinks when traveling - it has fit every one) and you can drain and refill during the bath.  We keep our little one warm by placing a wet, warm washcloth on her belly while we wash her hair (since this tub is in the sink and has the plug to pull - we leave the water running and can -re-warm her washcloth over and over) - a higher water level would be unsafe.  There is nothing I would change about this tub.  We'd keep using it except our daughter is sitting alone now and we think she's ready to play in the big tub.",5

"The Mommy Hook, Black with Black Pad","I bought this product thinking it looked heavy duty, like it would last.  I liked the idea of the foam wrapper protecting my purse.  Within two weeks of receiving the mommy hook, the spring snapped open and the hook would no longer close.  It wasn't as though I had put a lot of weight on it - all I had used it for was a small purse (less than 2 pounds).  I sent it back to the store and got a replacement.  After only two uses, the same thing happened to the mommy hook.  We were traveling at the time, and did not want to carry the useless hook around, so we threw it out.  We had contacted the store we ordered it from right away after the second one broke, and they directed us to the manufacturer.  We contacted the manufacturer immediately, but they have declined to replace the second broken mommy hook.  I could understand if the product did not hold up under heavy weight, or over a long period of time, but two hooks breaking in the same manner after only a few light uses means this is a defective product.  I have done as my husband suggested originally and gotten a less expensive, but more durable, carabiner from the hardware store, and that is holding up well.",1

"Infantino Twist and Fold Gym, Baby Animals","I am so glad we have this.  We got it at a discounted price, but I think it would be worth the full price as well.  My baby has spent much time enjoying this and we've only had it for 2 months.  My baby was only 3 months when we got it and I really didn't think he would enjoy it until he was a little older, but the first time I put him on it he was very interested in the toys.  He accidentally bumped one with his hand and then was fascinated trying to get a hold of them.  Also he loves talking to himself in the mirror.  I have been very happy with this purchase.  To address some of the negative comments let me say. 1. It is possible to fold this as shown,  it's not extremely intuitive or as easy as they make it sound on the package, but it is possible.  2.  Yes, be prepared the first time you turn the know to &#34;collapse&#34; it.  It is a bit surprising.  3.  No it doesn't have lots of &#34;bells and whistles&#34; but it's meant for small infants.  I'm not sure that a newborn needs lights and music on every toy they own.  4.  No the pillow isn't great, but I didn't purchase the toy for the pillow.  And no the pillow doesn't attach to the mat as the directions state.  The editor must have been on vacation.  The things I really like about this are,  1. You could use this from day one with your baby 2. The included toys are soft and switchable.  You could put any toy with a link on this. 3. Foldable for storage and/or travel.  Also it seems pretty durable.  My toddler is also interested in it and can get a little rough and it has withstood that so far.  I haven't washed it yet, so I can't comment on that, but the fabric is nice and wipeable. I usually put a burp rag under my baby when he is on this anyway",5

It's so soothing that I enjoy listening to it over the monitor at night.  It plays the tune 4 or 5 times I believe and that is plenty of time for my son to fall asleep.  When he gets older I'll start using the light show and moving birdies but for now, he's perfectly happy just listening to the soothing music for a long nights sleep.",5

Sliding Door Locks,"I can rate this product high because it serves the purpose in which I intended to use it. I wish I can say how well it works to keep babies or small children out of the closets but I can't. The purpose of these items are to keep my cats our of the closets. Yes, my cats are capable of opening the wooden closet doors and like to sleep or hide in there. Unfortunately, they leave hair everywhere inside and on my clothes. One cat became ill with stomach problems and left a mess on the floor and near my dress shoes. Therefore, I had to put a stop to this soon. I then found these locks which stick very very well and are currently going strong after a month or so since I purchased them. Therefore, even if you don't have small children to keep safe, you can also use these for your pets. I love the locks...and of course, my pets.",5

Dr. Brown's Formula Mixing Pitcher,Lifesaver!  Using this allows us to give half or single ounces and it mixes any formula with NO bubbles or foam!  Major time and money saver!,4
"Frenchie Mini Couture X-Large Absorbent Hooded Towel, Duck","I ordered this towel for my 18 month old. He is a tall boy for his age, now i can wrap him properly and the material is very soft for his delicate skin. The ducks are really cute.. he loved it and smiles every time he sees it :)",5
WubbaNub Pink Bear,"The WubbaNub makes a great gift.  And, the best part is that it helps you find the pacifier easier and it helps to limit the times it's dropped on the ground!  I've added WubbaNub as a baby must have!",5
"Lillian Rose 1st Birthday Keepsake Memory Book, Pink, 7&quot;",Beautiful memory keeper.  So glad I bought it.  It completed the decor and made it easier to keep track of who made it to the party and the gifts.,5
"Supergate Extra-Wide Gate, Ivory","This is the second baby gate we bought. The first one (a different model) was flimsy wooden one  and it broke so we bought this one as a replacement. This gate is sturdy , works well, and is a decent length.",5
"The First Years 6 Pack Ziploc Toddler Bowl, 8 Ounce","I have lots of different small bowls like these, and I happen to love them.  They have gotten some poor reviews that I disagree with.First, the lids and bowls do have grooves.  BUT they are not meant to screw together.  The lids snap right on, and the threads help keep them on.  The lids also snap off easily, but not easily enough that they will come off unintended.  So if you don't try to unscrew the lids and just pop them off, you will not encounter any problems with these bowls.  I cannot imagine an adult having trouble taking the lids off.  A toddler might need help.Second, they are better for dry snacks and solid foods.  They are OK for applesauce and purees, but there are better options for those and liquids, such as the newer 'take and toss' bowls.Third, the colours are brighter than pictured.Fourth, they hold 1 cup of food each (measured to the fill line).Fifth, they are microwavable and clean up well in the dishwasher.  This is great.  For example, some of the Nuby bowls melt in the microwave.",5
Bassinet Sheets 3-pk. - Blue,I guess they are okay for the price but these are incredibly rough sheets!,2
"Kissa's Pail Liner, White","It does the job. It is not waterproof which was an unrealistic expectation of mine. If you spray/soak your cloth diapers, the bag will get noticeably wet from the outside. It does its job, but don't expect it to be a plastic bag. It washes easy with the diapers, so its convenience more than makes up for this issue.",4
Baby Einstein Music and Discovery Travel Mirror,My husband and I bought this mirror in order to see our son while driving. My son loved this mirror. It would put him to sleep whenever we went out. I did not like that it doesn't lay right on the seat so I would have to lean far back or turn around in my seat to see him. When changing the batteries make sure to push the button really hard to make it work again. My friend came by and smacked mine to make it work again since she had the same problem.,4
"Planet Wise Wipe Pouch, Art Deco",I love this product. It is very spacious & easy to carry. I can fit 8-10 cloth wipes (according to the brand) inside.,5
Peg Perego Venezia SNG Carriage / Stroller - Chesapeake,"2003 Review: I spent four weeks researching strollers before I finally bought this one for my six-month old. My research involved going to all of the product websites, reading customer reviews, stopping people with various strollers on the street, talking with friends, and trying them each out in the stores. I had been borrowing an infant car-seat/snap-and-go combo from a friend for the first six months of my daughter's life and knew what I liked and didn't like about that stroller. In a city where your primary means of transportation is walking, a good-quality, durable stroller is critical --so you do need to spend a bit more money.After seriously evaluating the Evenflo Comfort system, the Graco Metrolite, the Combi TravelSavvy, the Maclaren Volo & Techno, the Bertini M5, the Peg Perego Pliko and this one, I had pretty much narrowed it down to the Peg Perego Venezia and the comparably priced and ubiquitous MacLaren Techno because they were the most durable and easiest to handle of the lot. The MacLaren is lighter and folds up smaller, but only marginally so, and I am forever spotting little sleeping childeren umcomfortably slumped forward in their MacLarens like coach class passengers on an overnight flight: the MacLaren's seats don't fully recline; and that is important when you are on long strolls/shopping trips that run into nap-time. Kids in MacLarens just look less comfortable and cozy than those in the Peg Perego. So after much backing and forthing, I took the chance on the Peg Perego. I'm really glad I did.I had a feeling I'd made a stellar choice as soon as I took it out of the box.  I was able to assemble it without even looking at the instructions: unlike so many items I've bought for my baby, it's operation was perfectly intuitive. It rides like a cadillac on the treacherous New York City sidewalks (pot holes, ice lumps, gravely streets, ramp-less curbs) and handles so well I can steer it with one hand --as easily as the MacLaren. It's not quite as small when folded, but it folds up so compactly into a standing position that it stays out of the way in our cramped NYC digs. It also has plenty of storage space in the lower basket that can be accessed while the seat is fully reclined (storage space is critical to the carless Manhattan resident) and it has much more of it than the MacLarens have. Note also that storage space was a deal-breaker with the Peg Perego Pliko, too: it is completely inaccessible from above --you have to slip items under a metal frame from the side. The Venezia's adjustable handle is nice and high so that you don't have to stoop to walk with it (I'm 5'7""). It's as high as the one on the MacLaren Techno. I also love the bunting that allows it to be used as a cozy baby-carriage in the winter. Another cold-weather plus: the hood folds all the way down to to completely cover the baby in case of a sudden rain or windstorm. The Venezia fabric is by far the classiest and I've gotten many a compliment on it already. Sure, it would be nice to have a parent cup-holder, but the stroller handles so well  you can hold a cup in one hand and steer with the other --and it's probably a lot safer than having a cup of liquid positioned just over the baby's head. This is a great stroller, even for the price. I would recommend it to anyone, but especially to the City-dweller.2005 Edit to this review: This stroller was great until my daughter was 18 months old. After that, it became too cumbersome to steer with the extra weight. I bought a MacLaren Volo and have used that one since. I would still use this stroller if I had another baby, but only for the first year and a half. I still recommend the Venezia, but I recommend buying the Volo when baby gets too heavy and/or when it doesn't need/can't fit in the wonderful bunting the Venezia offers.",5
"Kaloo Lilirose Doudou Rabbit, Round",Great toy! It is soft and comfy. My baby has to have when she wants to sleep. It is also not a big toy si she can has it on the bed with her.,5
Billy Bob Teethe Thumb Sucker Pacifier,I got this for my cousin's son and I must say I didn't expect it to be realistic at all but it really was! It came quick in the mail which was a good surprise. All and all I would highly recommend this product and seller.,5
Sassy Water-Filled Teethers 2 Pack,I bought a package of these teethers while on a road trip and unfortunately left one of them behind. These were the only teethers that my daughter likes so far! I ordered two packs of them from Amazon; one was the pink purple and other blue. They are both the same texture and softness. They are great!!!,5
"Miracle Blanket Baby Swaddle Blanket, Pink","Our baby would not sleep at all because her arms would be moving all night long waking herself up. We also called her Houdini because she would get out of any other swaddles. This one did the trick. You could tell that she enjoyed it because as soon as she was swaddled, she would  relax and fall asleep.We would certainly recommend this blanket...certainly worked miracles with our baby.",5

"Bamboobies 2 Pair Ultra-Thin Regular Nursing Pads, Pale Pink","I bought these to try them out since I'm still nursing (longer than I anticipated) and I wanted to stop wasting money on disposables. So far they're great. I haven't had any issues with them staying in place (I do the upside-down use) and they soak up what I leak, which isn't much. I will have to get more soon :-)",5
"Summer Infant, Ultimate Training Pad - Twin Mattress, 38&quot; x 28&quot;","I bought the Handy's Plus Pad because, while our son has been potty trained for nearly a year, he sleeps so soundly that he doesn't wake up all the time to go pee at night, and I've had it with changing the bed sheets everyother night! This pad is a great item, it's soft on the top so my son doesnt mind sleeping on it and it really works keeping the sheets dry. My son sleeps all over the place and it's plenty wide enough to give the coverage we need. And it's never leaked through. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that it's tough to tuck the far side in when you have the bed up against the wall like we do. I'm not sure how they could make this better, but they should work on figuring out a way. ;) I only wish I'd gotten 2!!",4

The First Years miPump Double Electric Breast Pump,"I am sure you could buy a pump with all the same benefits as the Mii for a lot more money... that is the biggest benefit to this pump; it's cheap. It's cheap, easy to use, and gets the job done. My only issue with it is the actual positioning of the suction cups; sometimes they snap in a different direction than I set. I am small breasted, size B, so maybe this isn't an issue for other woman. Overall, I love how quickly it works, all the different settings, and how easy it is to clean!",5
"HALO SleepSack Big Kids Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Red, 2T- 3T","I bought this for my 22 month old daughter because her old sleep sack was getting tight on her. She is petite for her age so I expected this new, gigantic sleep sack to fall right off. I was pleasantly surprised to see how cozy she looked in it. I think it was designed to be a little baggy and lay on kids just as a blanket would. This sleep sack more than exceeded my expectations. I just wish I had discovered it for my older 2 kids when they were babies!",5
Philips AVENT BPA Free Twin Electric Breast Pump,This pump works well. I am not sure if it works as good as or better than a medela though since I have only used this electric pump (aside from hospital pump). My main complaint is the number of pieces that you have to wash before each use...you have to wash:the 2 bottlesthe 2 adapter ringsthe 2 main pump componentsthe 2 silicone pedal piecesthere are 2 silicone inner pump pieces2 membranes1 hard plastic pump connecterTHATS 13 PIECES!Not sure if other pumps have less pieces or not but that is allot of pieces to wash if you are pumping 6 + times per day!,4
"SwaddleDesigns Marquisette Swaddling Blanket, Elephant &amp; Chickies, Pastel Blue","I do not use this to swaddle, but as a lightweight blanket for my toddler during the summer. It is great! Large enough to comfortably cover a two year old and it's nice and light. I plan to buy another one! The print is adorable, too.",5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Toddler Bed, Pink","I bought this for my 18 month old, and will bring it out every now and then for her to play on. She will bring her toys on it, and get on and off during her play time.I haven't used it outside, but it should work well enough if you have level ground to work with.It works very easily, and I use it exactly as I envisioned.",5
Sassy Snap and Squirt Sea Creatures,"These are darling colorful sea creatures, that my 22 month old loves to play with.  They don't squirt properly, and water doesn't drain well from them, causing mildew.  But, they are well made, and he loves to play with them on dry land.  If you want a fun and functional bath toy, don't buy these.  But, it you want a fun toy that snaps together, and is colorful and well made, this set will do nicely.",4
North States Supergate Extra Wide Wire Mesh Gate,Used this for my brand new puppy . She was really small so she was able to put her paws in the holes and climb up it. The gate also leaves marks on the wall if  the notch on the gate doesn't match the width of the opening you're using it for. The gate is well made and definitely stays in place. I can see this gate working for children or dogs who's paws are larger than the holes (approx. 1 1/2 inches wide). Super fast shipping !! This transaction was perfect from start to finish.,4

Infant Optics DXR-5 2.4 GHz Digital Video Baby Monitor with Night Vision,"This monitor has the potential to be really good.  We've owned it for a year or so now.  It is our second video baby monitor, the first having been the Levana babyview 2.0.  The night vision is pretty good, so is the quality of sound & picture.  Some of the problems we've had have to do with the inflexibility of the camera.  We had to rearrange furniture to get something at a level near the crib that was workable for the camera's limited tilt range.  However, the biggest problem has been the poor battery life.  After just one and a half hours off the charger, it dies.  This makes it hard to do anything after my kids are asleep.  It seems like I just start to get things done, I look over & the monitor is off.  This was very disappointing.  Our babyview had at least 3 hours, many times, 4 hours before the power button would even start to flash.  Even though I'm currently looking for a new monitor for our third child, I will not consider this an option until at least the battery problem is solved.  I originally bought this because of the price, features & the fact that accessories can be purchased online.  I've been sorely disappointed.  This monitor is meant to be portable.  You can't carry around the monitor when you have to plug it in so often.",3
"Carters Keep Me Dry Flannel Lap Pads, Ecru, 3 Pack","My baby is due in July, so I haven't actually used these yet... But they seem really high quality in the sewing and fabric. The print is super cute. I washed these with the rest of the baby clothing on delicate/warm setting, and hung them off the edge of the bassinet to dry as they were barely damp when I switched the clothes to the dryer. These were completely dry in less than ten minutes... which will be good when I have a baby that needs them cleaned asap. :) I will update these once my little one is here to test the product on.",5
"Cosco Umbria Stroller, Zigzag",A great handy stroller that folds up easily and takes up little space for trips to the mall.  Easy to use and has small storage below.,5
"UPPAbaby G-Luxe Stroller, Jake/Black","I have own this stroller for about a year and a half.  At first I loved it!  It is beautiful!  But once you start to use it, the wheels start to squeak and the steering is horrible!  I now have the hardest time opening my stroller and getting my toddler around in it.  I don't use it everyday only for trips. I purchased this stroller with the idea that it would last me until by child was to big to sit in it.  But I am now looking for yet another stroller to replace this one.  My daughter loves to sit in this and can nap in it, so it is very comfy but I have the hardest time taking her any where in it. The company is great to work with the will try and send you new wheels as they are stating that the wheels need to be replaced. They will work for a few strolls than the will start to squeak again.  I have a bumble ride indie and this stroller is amazing!! I just was looking for something a little more compact and easy to travel with.",1
Carry You Sicily Double Stroller Organizer,There is just simply no way to get even a slim bottle in the end slots like it shows in the picture.  The rest is fine and seems to be staying in place with our stroller.  Big bummer about the drinks though as that was the part we really wanted for kids cups especially!,3
"HALO SleepSack 100% Cotton Wearable Blanket, Print Boy, Large",I absolutely love this SleepSack! It's perfect to keep baby warm on cool nights with out worrying about blankets falling off and making baby cold. So cute too!

"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","I wish that I had this chair when my other son was a baby. It makes my son more at ease to sit and eat at the table with us, doesn't take up any extra space and it's sturdy and holds up to the wrath of a baby :)",5
KidCo Outlet Plug Cover 2 Pack,"i love that this cover the larger plugs but im not happy that it opens more easily than it should for being made for child safety, my son is 18 months old and i promise if hes near it for 5 minutes he will have it opened, you do have to pull the little tab that sticks out, toward you to keep it from just sliding open but if your kid is remotely smart they will open this pretty easily, im using packing tape to tape mine shut so he cant open it but i do like that it keeps him away from tyhe poutlets for now anyways and its the only one ive found thats big enough to close with a 3 prong plug in it!!!",4
"My Brest Friend Original Pillow, Bluebells","This was the best nursing pillow I tried. it is comfortable, supportive, and easy to clean the cover. Of course, milk leaks through the cover and the foam is not easy to clean, but it doesn't smell or anything (yet). So when I was learning to BF, it was great to have a pillow to rely on. But as we've gone along, I find that we nurse EVERYWHERE in the house, not just in one place. And it's a pain for me and the baby to have to go get the nursing pillow and bring it to where we want to be every time he eats. So it doesn't get much use anymore.",4
"Born Free Twin Pack Wide Neck Bottles, 5 Ounce","I highly recommend these bottles.  Since they are expensive, we just have fewer of them than we would have with other brands - you are supposed to wash bottles soon after use anyway.  I was concerned about bisphenol-A in other bottles, and feel much better using these.  I mostly breastfeed my baby, and he still took to this bottle right away.",5
"Britax Pavilion 70-G3 Convertible Car Seat Seat, Onyx","It's VERY heavy and not that easy to install.  Otherwise, great; seems very safe.  We have two of these in use right now and like them a lot.  Works well on planes as well as in the car.  It is a large seat, but it rides high so it's comfortable to sit next to it in the car/plane.",5
Rockabilly Mom Punk Rock Skull and Cross Bones Diaper Bag / Weekend Bag,"I wasn't expecting the material to be shiney, but it isn't too bad. It may not be worth the price. It is basically for looks. It has 2 side pockets for bottles and a hidden pocket inside with a changing matt. It is great if you have one baby because it doesn't hold alot. Overall I liked it. It was the alternative to the diaper dude bag, which was twice the price as this one",4
"Oeuf Classic Toddler Bed, Birch",I would probably take one star off due to the high price but customer service at Oeuf is so good that it would need to be added back on!Excellent bed with high enough rails. Overall stylish and slick. Our kid LOVES it and I am excited to use this bed until she is 5.Best part that if we should be able to convert it to the crib one day (you would need to go through Oeuf directly to get the backwards conversion kit).,5
Evenflo Tribute Convertible Car Seat - Watertown,"I ordered this for another ""granny"" who wanted a safe and comfortable seat to keep in her car.  She had admired mine.  It's been through one granddaughter and has started on another.  As far as comfort goes, it far surpasses most.  The padded bar, when lowered, not only provides protection, but a place to prop a book or toy.  For children who are in the car a lot, this is the one to pick!",5
"NUK Toddler Rest Easy Toothbrush, Color May Vary","Perfect handle, perfect size. Great value for the price. You can purchase multiples so you're ready to swap out used ones (especially when your toddler (and this WILL happen) chews on the bristles during brush sessions...!)",5
"Kidkusion Jumbo Edge Kushion, Black","I ordered this product because we have a 9 month old that is trying to walk and we want to avoid her from hurting herself on the brick that's build around the fire place. The instructions show to clean surface clean, but, how can you clean brick well enough for the not so adhesive tape to stick, NOT. The tape that comes with it is not strong enough for attaching to brick, my husband and I will now improvise.",2
"Maclaren Easy Traveller Car Seat Carrier, Silver/Black","I use this with my Chicco Keyfit 30. It came with an adapter bar that is supposed to help the Chicco sit correctly. However, I think that the bar makes the carseat slant too far forward - the line on the carseat that is supposed to be level with the ground while the carseat is in the car is not level. It's not tilted enough to make me worry, though.My main issue with using this stroller is that the safety strap is extremely difficult to adjust, and I still don't have it quite as tight as I would like because the labels sewn to the strap prevent me from feeding the strap through the connector any further. It's secure enough, but I don't understand why they made it so difficult to tighten.Another issue - it's a bit hard to access the storage once the carseat is on the stroller. I find that it's easier to access it from the front. There is so much space in the basket, though, that I can overlook this. The size of the storage basket was a major reason I chose this over other brands.Overall, I really like this stroller. I compared it to other brands, and found that it pushes more smoothly and I like that it folds more compactly than others. At least one of the other brands just folds flat, while the Maclaren folds like an umbrella stroller. This makes it much easier for me to put it in my car - I can easily put it in the backseat if the trunk is full. It's also light - I could pick it up with no worries after my c-section.It's not perfect, and if I had known Chicco was going to come out with one especially for the Chicco Keyfit I would have waited, but the Maclaren meets my needs well enough and is well-made.",4
"Summer Infant Changing Pad Cover, Who Loves You Owl","I bought this changing pad because I loved the design. I ended up not having to need it because I decided not to have a changing pad. A few weeks later, a friend of mine gave me the Arms Reach Mini Co-Sleeper, and found out that it works perfectly for the cover! A great use for an adorable design!",5
"Skip Hop Changing Pad Cover, ABC","I am very happy with this changing pad cover. It is cotton and very soft, and the colors are nice and bright. It fits perfectly in our nursery. It took me a while to finally decide to buy it, because I think $25 is too pricey for something like this, but it was too cute to resist and I finally gave in.",4

Aden and Anais UpAwaySwddleBlnkts,"My mom-in-law says these blankets are ""how they used to make them in her days"", and that's her highest praise.  Very soft and airy, and come out after washing and drying even softer and 'airier' (some other blankets I own come out flatter and flatter after every wash, are more expensive and not this soft).  My baby loves them, and they are truly 'all-purpose' blankets now.  The best thing about them is that they keep baby cool in warm weather, because they are so light and breathy, but if you fold them they can be pretty warm.  Good size, too.  And they wash well.  I'm not surprised they got so many positive reviews - they deserve them.  I'm recommending these to all my friends!",5
"Angel Dear Blankie, Green Frog","My granddaughter was given &#34;Mr. Who&#34; as a newborn and every night for bed she held tightly onto his soft body. About a month ago she spent some In the hospital and in the change of rooms Mr. Who was lost. We checked the lost and  found and I went to every baby store, but no replacement. One day babysitting I decided to Google Angel Dear Blanket Owl and sure enough Amazon had it!  My order came in a few days and it was perfect! My sweetie now has her Mr. Who. back for nightie-night. I am thrilled. I plan to order more for upcoming baby showers.",5

Microwave Steam Sterilizer,Great Product!  I usually have to use this twice in a row because it does not hold everything I need to sterilize.Other then that it does a good job.

"green sprouts 10 Pack Waterproof Absorbent Terry Bibs, Girls","These bibs are super absorbent and nothing leaks through to my baby's clothes. A great selection of colors as well.  The velcro is very strong and is a little bit sharp, so be careful when taking the bib off--I accidentally caught it on my baby's neck and it left a pretty good scratch.Be sure to fasten the bibs before placing them in the wash, or they wil;l stick to your other clothing.",5
Bedtime Originals Treasure Island Wallpaper Border,"This was very difficult to put up and didn't stay. We followed the directions to a T and after a day or two, the border was coming off the wall. We tried everything, but it wrinkled and peeled off starting from edges and corners. We have normal walls without texture or anything but this was a dud. It left a yellowy stain on the wall. Returned it for a refund. SO not worth the trouble!",1
"Boppy Infant and Toddler Head Support, Grey",I recommend this product to be used at the first sign of flat head. Holds up in the wash too. So wonderful I passed it on to friends when we out grew it.,5
"Bumkins Cloth Diaper Sprayer, Chrome","I also decided on this diaper sprayer because it had the most positive reviews (though fewer reviews overall). I was prepared for a major installation project, but was pleasantly surprised that it only took 30 minutes or less. The instructions were very thorough and complete with step by step pictures. Simple and no leaks! The only thing I'm not so sure about is if the pressure is high enough. Will update once I try it on the cloth diapers.Update- Just as I thought, the pressure is not adequate...little better than a sink sprayer. Will have to try a different one :(",5
"Britax 2 Pack Baby Carrier Bib Set, White","Now that she can face outward in her baby carrier, our little one loves seeing everything during our walks. Of course the downside is that she drools all over the baby carrier.  The bib set is great for soaking up all that extra moisture.  I always keep a spare in the diaper bag just in case she gets a bit to excited during our walks.",5
Medela Harmony Manual Breast Pump,"I started pumping with the Medela hands free super-expensive-amazing-pump because that's the pump my daughter's pediatrician recommended.  Well, apparently I'm a very productive milk producer (I would have been recruited to be a wet nurse back in the day!) and using an electric pump overstimulates me to the point of engorgement which lasted consistently for the first two full painful months after her birth (I'm stubborn).  So I chucked pumping altogether - until I now have to go back to work and I want to try to keep feeding my little one breast milk until about a year.  The amazing thing about this hand pump is the suction is in your control.  You can stimulate and as soon as the milk starts, you can let it flow much more easily than with the electric pump - because you have control.  Don't feel bad if you can't afford the electric pump - this on is GREAT and I prefer it.  On another note, you can purchase any kind of breast milk container you want to store it in because you'll pump straight into a bottle from which you can pour into bags that you've labeled already.  Easy peazy.  Consideration:  This pump is not too hard on the wrists but I might question using a hand pump at all if I had carpal tunnel.",5
"Tiny Love Take Along Mobile, Animal Friends","I bought this for my son's bassinet, and it doesn't attach to the side of it. The mobile just spins around and falls over because it is not able to attach to the bassinet securely. I'm thinking this is because the bassinet has a layer of fabric around it, otherwise I think it would be fine. I really wanted to like this mobile, it seems perfect and so multi-functional... but I will be returning because it doesn't work for us :(",2
Sassy Fascination Station,"I actually don't mind the music.  It.Just.Won't.Turn.Off.  There is some position of the wheel where the slightest vibration will set if off, invariably as soon as the baby is asleep.It also has pretty poor suction, even when the suction is wet.  As soon as baby is strong enough to grasp it, it's gone.If you don't mind constant music, and use it as a rattle/hand toy, it's fine.",2
The First Years Clean Air Diaper Disposal System,"I LOVED this diaper pail at first.  It used regular kitchen bags, I liked the feature of the lid disposing of the diaper, and there was virtually no odor until it came time to change the filter. However, I had two of them...one upstairs and one downstairs. They had BOTH stopped working around 8 or 9 months.  One of them breaking would be unfortunate, but both of them breaking means that they are junk.",1
"Beco Butterfly II Organic Baby Carrier with Brown Base, Espresso","This was a great purchase.  Totally worth the money.  It is easy to use and comes with an instructional video which is very helpful.  I use this with my 6-week old and he falls asleep every time.  Comes in handy whenever I need to clean around the house or take walks around the neighborhood.  The fabric is very soft.  I love that I can secure my baby in there first before putting it on.  I would definitely recommend this to others with infants.  In fact, I am buying this as a gift for an upcoming baby shower.",5
"Britax Pavilion 70-G3 Convertible Car Seat Seat, Biscotti","We have been using this car seat for about 2 weeks and we love it! The quality and pattern (cowmooflouge) are two features that I love, but most of all the safety features. We upgraded to this from a Graco infant carrier and love it! Our daughter is 8 months old and very small, but was tired of laying back so far in the infant carrier. She seems so comfortable in this car seat! We are so excited for her to grow with this car seat and also have the ability to be comfortable and safe! I did have a little trouble the first day with getting the straps loose, but it's a breeze now that I have figured it out. Other reviews added that the seat is bulky and hard to get the baby in and out of... I don't think it's anymore difficult than putting her into the infant carrier.",5
"Itzy Ritzy Shopping Cart and High Chair Cover, Avocado Damask","It's so soft and cushy, looks the same on both sides, but still reversible...definitely has made shopping with baby so much easier. Baby loves it too. It's perfect. So far I've only been to Target and Homeland, they work great with both.",5
P'Kolino Full Size Puzzle Stacker,"I bought this for my son after looking for hours online for cute, cool, unique looking toys. I liked this style so much better than your traditional stacking rings. My only dislike is that the colors in the picture are super bright and bold but when I opened the package, the colors were dull and bland like just stained wood that didn't take the color well. I would have given 5 stars if the colors were true to the picture.",4
Fresh N Freeze 2 oz. Reusable Baby Food Containers 12-Pack,"If I had to do it again, I'd probably just buy baby food containers and then use those rather than buying these.  They work fine but are a bit pricey for what they are.That being said, they don't fall over in the freezer and are reasonably easy to wash.  No complaints about performance.",5
"Ah Goo Baby The Wipes Case, Audrey","This is nothing but a cheap piece of plastic covered in pretty material.  The container is not only poorly air-tight, but once closed, it is difficult to open.  One side will stick every time, so you have to use two hands and take several seconds to open it every time.  I was very certain I would get frustrated with this case over time, due to the difficult time it takes to open & the fact that the wipes would probably dry out.  So, I returned it promptly.",1
"Razbaby RaZ-berry Teether, Red",my little man loves this binky!! he loves eating the leaves and chewing on the raspberry part!! its a great teether! we've had no problems with it! i would buy it as a baby gift for friends/family!!! :),5
"Angel Dear Cashmere Soft Polyester Blankie, Blue Owl","This company has everything right!  The fabric is so soft and they last and last after so many washings.  Over the past 2 years we have ordered six or seven of these.  My grandson has been using one since he was a newborn and we have one in his crib, one in each car, one in the stroller bag, one in the diaper bag and an extra one in storage as a backup in case one gets lost.  He love, loves, loves this little item and it works like magic to soothe him when he's crying or needs to go to sleep.  We had several differnt lovies and this was the only one he fell in love with and because it has no rattle in it it's great for sleeping.  The lovies with a rattle would wake him up if he was drifting off to sleep because every time he moved it would rattle.",5
Medela Harmony Manual Breast Pump,i like the madela so much that it's very comfortable and i can make with a 3.5 oz in 30 minutes,5
Dex Dura Bib Big Mouth (Green - Lion),"These bibs are great! Got given one as a gift and was really disappointed when they werent available in the country I live. So pleased to be able to buy one on Amazon and get it shipped.  So great for a messy eater, picking up all the drips and crumbs. Love the fun designs. Very easy to wipe down and wash.  I wouldnt go without one now, will buy them as gifts and highly recommend them as a must have purchase for infants and toddlers!",5
"Athena Daphne, Kimberly Crib Changing Table Pad","When I had my first child, I bought a convertible crib that came with a changing station that would later convert to a night stand.  The pad that came with the crib wore out and I had to throw it away after my first born grew out of it.  I also didn't expect to have another child, but I am... and I hunted IN VAIN in every outlet and store I could find and no one made a changing pad 15x28, which is the size of my builtin changing station.  Very Frustrating.Then I looked on Amazon and found this pad.  It is PERFECT!  It fit exactly to what I needed and I was able to find some Carter's brand waterproof pad covers to layer on it and I even found some bassinet sheets that fit over it as well.  It will provide more than enough padding for my new little one!",5
Baby Einstein Around The World Play Gym,"I had to recently return this to Amazon for a refund because it kept collapsing on our daughter and would fold up around her like a burrito! DANGEROUS! It really is a bummer because she LOVED the playmat and ALL of the toys. SOOOOOOOO cute and really the most adorable playgym we found. Several of the toys were her favorites and I am so sad we had to return them. But the toys were heavy and if she kicked or grabbed the arches (which I think were positioned to close together), the whole thing would fall over (top heavy from the toys being heavy) and wrap around her. We finally returned it for safety and are looking for another one.With my son we had another Baby Einstein ocean style playgym and it had a music box that hung in between the arches (on the side) so it didn't allow it to fold up and collapse like this one.",2
Playtex Diaper Genie On The Go Dispenser,I love this item. It comes in handy when traveling and my new grandson needs to be changed. I dont liter so this is perfect and keeps us from having to hold our nose. lol,5
"Dr. Sears Nibble Tray, Yellow/Green, 12 Months",I have a free range 17 month old grazer and this is perfect! We use it for dry snack and a small amt of cheese and fruit. I know when he gets older I will be able to use the green cold part for dips for years to come!  Perfect size..I love everything about this nibble tray!,5
Potty Time Potty Watch - Blue,"Sure, it's a bit chintzy, but what do you expect--it costs $9.99!  Also, consider its purpose.  Do you really want your toddler wearing something luxurious and expensive around all that fecal matter?  I found this device to be a helpful addition to my cohort of potty training accessories.  My daughter found it exciting, and it really did help her remember to go.  I'd recommend it for the price.  Who cares if it only lasts a few weeks?  Your kid will hopefully be fully potty trained by that time, anyways. Also, it's shaped like a little toilet.  How cute is that?",4
Mary Meyer Ella Bella 10&quot; Elephant Wind Up Musical,This little musical elephant is just adorable.  It is as pictured and the music is soft which would not startle very small babies.  I was very pleased with the product and the fast delivery service.  J. Jackson,5
900 MHz Home Connection Monitor,"When I received the Home Connection Monitor one of the receivers had a constant and intolerable clicking sound no matter where it was placed in my home.  The other receiver worked okay, other than that the volume was extremely low and there was a considerable amount of static.  I was unable to hear my daughter get out of bed and leave her room even at the highest volume.  Because this was the only monitor of its kind that I was able to find, I decided to give it a try despite the problems.  I even went out and purchased a new cordless phone with a different frequency to eliminate any possible interference.  We do not have a satellite dish or alarm system so these were not an issue.  After a couple of weeks of use the one working monitor began to have periods of extremely loud static, so that nothing else could be heard through it, and this soon became constant, so that it was unusable.This is the worst quality product I have ever received and I am extremely disappointed and frustrated. Despite the numerous bad reviews and obvious problems with the product, Amazon refused to cover return shipping charges when I returned it.  My advise, don't waste your time or money.",1
Imperial 4 Tier Plastic Cupcake / Dessert Stand - Up to 24 Cupcake Holder Stand White,"This stand is so cute, easy to put together, sturdy, and a great price...I would definitely recommend it to anyone.",5
"Britax Marathon 70-G3 Convertible Car Seat, Onyx","I ordered this car seat on saturday in the afternoon and it was on my doorstep late monday! I love Amazon! I got it out of the box and my 1 year old son automatically started playing it in.  He loves it.  When I put it in my car (Acura TL) it was super easy to install and I placed it rear facing.  I was afraid my super tall husband was not going to be able to drive, since he puts his seat soooooooo far back, but even in the center of the backseat, the driver's seat was able to go very far back without touching.  I love the velcro that keeps the straps off to the sides so you don't have to yank them out from under your child's back. This was the one complaint I had also. One side the velcro on the seat doesn't quite match the velcro on the strap, but I called Britax and they sent me a new cover and now it matches perfectly.  I would totally recommend this product to a friend(I actually have already!)",5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","We used sleep sacks for my daughter when she was an infant - I feel better at night knowing they are covered, without the possibility of blankets over their face.",4
Levana Jena Digital Baby Video Monitor with 8 Hour Rechargeable Battery and Talk to Baby Intercom,"I have never purchased a video baby monitor before, but this one was a great price and I figured that because of the video element I can use it a lot longer. So far I really like this product, it is very easy to set up and figure out how to use. I really like that the camera plays lullabies and you can talk to the baby.",5
"Peg Perego Convertible Infant to Toddler Car Seat, Black","This is the best car seat I have ever seen!  It was pricey, but worth every penny.  It sits solidly in my vehicle, and my granddaughter loves it.  The quality is superior to anything I have ever seen, especially compared to Chinese-made produts.  I would recommend this car seat wholeheartedly as the best on the market.",5
"Munchkin Powdered Formula Dispenser Combo Pack, Colors May Vary","WIth my first child I used an earlier generation Sassy product.  I like that this one is a bit smaller.  It's plenty big for formula or baby cereal; the Sassy product was unnecessarily bulky given that it was for on-the-go.  One thing I really miss that the Sassy had is a tab on the top so that it could be opened more easily.  This one is a hassle to open.  Hardly impossible but you really have to grip the top and pull.  When you're out and about and desperate to make a bottle, this is annoying.  The Sassy had a tap you could push up on and that was a big help. It never opened accidentally and the lid was tight and stayed on.  Really, really wish the Munchkin had it. I also find that the Munchkin holds on to a bit of powder you just can't get out, more so than the Sassy. Otherwise, it functions and washes up well, glad I have it.",4
Cotton Tale Designs Pirates Cove 4 Piece Crib Bedding Set,"We ordered this for our daughter's baby shower and it is every bit as cute as the picture!  The quality is excellent for the price.  I would highly recommend this for a unique, brightly colored nursery.",5
Little Giraffe Chenille Blanky - Celadon,"this is my child's """"lovey"""" and he's 100% in love with them.  i've had to purchase 3 of them because he won't sleep without them.",5
"Goldbug Animal 2 in 1 Harness, Horse",It's a pretty neat little backpack for when you want to let your child be mobile within a certain range of you.  Great for walking in the parks.  Our in-laws loved it.,5
"Britax Car Seat Travel Bag, Black","barely survived its first trip aboard an aircraft. I'll give it some credit, that it may have experienced unusual handling with other checked bags. prior to that, it made carrying the seat much more comfortable.",3
The First Years 16 Piece Take &amp; Toss Infant Spoons,GREAT PRICEE! I got these as an add on. They were double at WM! Glad I bought them w amazon. They are easy for my son to old and just the right length too.,5
"Ju-Ju-Be Be Mine Wallet, Brown/Bubblegum","I've had this Be Mine for about 3 years now and it's had maybe a years worth of use in that time as I switch purses to different colors from time to time.  I have never washed it but I have it in Mint/Julep and I think that is a good color for looking 'clean'.  I am very disappointed however that a fair bit of the silver from the star at the front has worn off and it now looks a bit tacky and 'old'  I am looking at buying another Ju-Ju-Be product (a bag) and wanted to buy another Be Mine in a different print despite this tacky looking star I have on my current one but they don'e make them in all the nice patterns! The rest of this product is awesome quality and great for organisation!  Overall I'm a bit annoyed that the products I want to buy aren't available in the patterns I want to buy.  The same can be said for the Be Major, it's not available in lots of the prints anymore :(",4
Go-Go Babyz Mini Travelmate,"This was absolutely necessary on our globe trotting trip recently. We brought our daughter's car seat (Diono Radian RXT) on the planes (and there were many). The Go-go babyz was great. Super helpful with navigating through the airport, loved that we didn't need to take our 1 year old out of her seat, we could just roll her along. Fits down plane aisles. Folds up pretty compact and stores in over head when you put the car seat onto the plane seat. Recommend for travelers with babies and car seats in tow.",5
"Standard Wonder Bib, 3 pack - Lime, Choc, Orange","Perfect...absorbant,durable,cute,big enough, no annoying velcro, wash well. Have ordered multiple sets for my son and just ordered some for my godchild.",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"Bought it for my 9 month old baby girl, she can sit resting her feet on the ground and her back and arms are well comfortable too. This potty will grow with her.",5
Piyo Piyo Pacifier Clip,"Cute, easy to wash, and my daughter loves playing with it. Only complaint is that it doesn't work with pacifiers with small lanyard  holes.",4
Econobum Full Kit,"I have never cloth diapered before and while pregnant with my 2nd child became interested in the whole idea.  I did a lot of reading and researching and in looking at the money and the reviews from many people, I decided that Econobum was the best choice.  It's true that the diaper covers aren't as fun or cute as other brands but when you can get everything you need for cloth diapering until potty training age for around $100, to me it was worth it.  Other brands with the fun patterns can cost $400-800 and especially since I didn't know how I was going to do with cloth diapering, I didn't want to spend an arm and a leg just for vanity's sake.  So many reviews said great things about Econobum, and the main things that got me were the price and the fact that so many people said they never leaked.  I am now almost 2 months in and would say I definitely like them.  The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because the prefolds are extremely bulky on a newborn.  I had read about this being a problem but figured it would be ok since my baby was large at birth, 8 lbs 13 oz and drinks a ton of formula each day - thus he is growing like a weed and is 6 weeks old and well over 11 lbs.  Anyway, the diapers will work for a newborn but just know they will look totally hysterical because they're so huge.  I admit I was/am embarrassed to take my son out in public with them on so until he gets big enough for them to fit and look normal we are using disposables when we leave the house!  Beyond that vanity, we do use them at home even though at 11 some pounds they are still very bulky on him.  I'm guessing when he gets closer to 15 they will start to fit better.  I have also considered ordering ""infant"" size prefolds that are smaller and just using those for now with the covers.  Doing that would still probably be cheaper than buying disposables for a few months.  As for washing them, I find it extremely easy.  I don't mind doing laundry and already do loads every other day or 2 days, so washing cloth diapers wasn't really an issue to me.  I have an LG front load set and it gets mine super clean.  They come out of the dryer smelling like fresh nothing - which is what is supposed to happen (mine have never smelled like urine or ammonia or feces).  I wash them on the sanitary cycle with a prewash and an extra rinse - I use Tiny Bubbles detergent and it works great - so far I've never had any stains.  I air dry the covers.  All in all I would definitely recommend this brand to anyone wanting to cloth diaper; even with the bulkiness for newborns I still think they work well and know they will work even better when my baby is a little bigger.",4
"Jeep Cherokee Sport Stroller, Brick Red",This is a great stroller is light. It was easy to assemble and is very sturdy. Nice colors as well as durable and a reasonable price. I am sure I will be using this for a long time.,5
"TL Care Organic Cotton Nursing Pads, Natural, 6 Count","I prefer these to other brands of cloth nursing pads and to the disposable kinds.  They will leak if I am really engorged, but otherwise they do the trick.  They are super soft, comfortable, and generously sized.",5
"Hudson Baby Coral Fleece 3D Animal Blanket, Blue",This is a good quality blanket. It's very cute and has held up over a dozen washes so far. I highly recommend it!,5
Boppy Custom Fit Total Body Pillow,"I wanted the whole piece and not in 3- velcor- pieces I am sure it will work for others but daughter wanted the whole piece, so that's is what she wants although she is the one expecting and not me.",4
"American Baby Company 100% Cotton Percale Fitted Portable/Mini Crib Sheet, Pink Dots","Perfect fit, good quality, nice price! Exactly what I as looking for in an extra sheet to match the porta-crib bedding set I had purchased earlier.  Washes well - continues to maintain its original color. I am very pleased with this purchase.",5
Animal Planet's Big Tub of Dinosaurs,"I purchased this set for my son's 2nd birthday.  I'm sure he will like it but I don't really feel like we got the quality, we paid for ($29).  The paint job on each piece reminds me of Dollar store toys, the mat is flimsy plastic (I won't be giving this to my son as it's a suffocation hazard), and the dinosaurs are very small.  I do like the fact they have their own tote/ box and all fit in nicely.  I will say that by looking at the picture, there's a little trick photography used - I should've paid closer attention to the details rather than the reviews.",2
"Lipper International 516P High Chair, Pecan","Poorly made chair ill fitting joints, screw plugs keep falling out.advertised as being made in Thailand but the box says made in Vietnam never would have bought anything made there.",1
"Regalo Easy Step Walk Thru Gate, White",super easy to get up asap! BUT not easy walk through. you need two hands to open. but its strong and I like it,5
DEX Products Baby Wipes Warmer,"I was that parent who said ""I'll never spoil my child with a wipe warmer--it will only encourage her to wear diapers longer."" And then I woke up and realized that warm wipes at night mean a baby who doesn't cry during changings and goes back to bed more easily--this could mean an extra half hour of sleep for me. I am now a big fan of the warmer. It works very quickly and doesn't dry them out, and the light is just bright enough to change the baby at night without waking her up. Definately a nice product.",5
Winnie the Pooh Photo Album Box Set in Pink,"Excellent little box for storage, and the photo album is very cute. Perfect item for you or as a gift.",5
"BABYBJORN Soft Bib, Red",Baby is able to tug straight down on this bib and it comes right off. Super frustrating!  In search of the other plastic bib that has a more locking-like closure.,1
Prince Lionheart Warmies Wipes Warmer,"We use this for cloth wipes and it works great. This is not intended for disposable wipes. We also tried the Munchkin one, but it left brown marks on the wipes and did not keep them warm. This is the way to go if you are using cloth wipes!I will say that the bamboo wipes that came with this really did not look good after a few washes, but we did not buy this just for the wipes.",5
Safety 1st 2 Pack Grip n' Go Cabinet Lock,"Yes these can be a pain at times to open if you don't have two hands, but isn't that the point? You DO NOT want little ones getting into what you are locking.For those of you having so much trouble please check that you are trying to take this off correctly. There is a spring button on the thick portion of the curve. You need to push that side against the handle it is locking with you simultaneously push the slide button on the side (both with the same hand). With your other hand pull the other side of the lock apart. I do not have a big issue with these locks at all. I would rather deal with these than those horrible zip tie cabinet locks. They do their job but man they eat up my fingers if I deal with them often. Either way, hands down this is the best cabinet lock I have found for non mushroom shaped cabinet handles. It keeps me from freaking out in the mornings cause my 5 year old has decided to scavenge through the kitchen and fridge for food and drinks and hide/eat them in his bedroom. Have had these for 5 months to the day.",5
BABYBJORN Cradle,I loved this bassinet. It's light enough to easily move around the house and easy to see through. The mesh makes me feel super safe since it's breathable all around. My only issue was that my baby was almost too tall for it at 2 months and 25&#34;. The weight limit was fine but length is too short.  Worth it if your baby isn't going to outgrow it so soon.,4
Little Green Pouch - Reusable Food Pouch - 4pk,"I purchased these in July 2013 and have only used these a handful of times, but the seals on two already ripped off after being filled and washed about 5 times. Also, the bottom of one started to leak through the seam. These weren't abused in any way either. Such a disappointment since these were kinda pricey for only 4. The idea is great, but I just wish they were a little more durable. I don't think I'll purchase again.",3
"Baby Buddy Secure-A-Toy, Navy/Red","Great for sippy cups, snack cups and even toys!!!  We liked this so much that we bought another set.  One for carseat and one set for the stroller....we use them pretty much everyday and have no complaints this far.",5
Sun Smarties Swim Diaper Skirt 12 MOS.,"Skirt and shirt run a bit big. My 12 month old is 29 inches and 19 lbs. She's not skinny or chubby just perfectly normal and it's a little big for the 12 month size but she hated to get her head squeezed with the other ones! Protects her from the sun prefectly. I have bought others where I could see the tan line on her where the shirt was white, this does not do that.",5
Munchkin Warm Glow Wipe Warmer and Diaper Bag Dispenser Set (Colors may vary),Even if you put water in this it dries the wipes on top due to the heater located in the top. Wipes get low and then the last wipes are extra wet due to water & cold since warmer is at the top. Don't waste your money...,1
Ikea PATRULL Non-Slip Bath Mat - Green Crocodile,Fits in our tub perfectly and allows our 8month old son to crawl around in the tub without slipping during bath time.,5

Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether Set of 2,My little one is absolutely head over heels for this little giraffe!!  When he sees it for the first time his eyes light up immediately.  It doesn't hurt that you do not have to worry about a recall or be concerned about the materials she is made of.,5
"ERGObaby Heart2Heart Infant Insert, Natural",My problem with the insert is how thick it is-down comforter thick.  It's just too hot for San Diego weather.  I strip him down to his onesie but we both get sweaty when I wear it.  I can't wait until he's big enough to go without it.,2
Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing -  Nature's Touch N1973,"Perfect for the littlest babies.  My little girl was just under 6 pounds and it kept her snug.  The only problem we had was that she was so little, on the slowest setting I thought it would sling her out, we just put a heavy blanket in it that touched the floor and it worked perfect.  She is now 8 months old and loves to just sit in it and watch her Baby Einstein DVD's.",5
North States Supergate Auto-Close Metal Gate,"We have an open floor plan and needed to gate off a wide space with an irritating combination of hollow walls, baseboards, and hidden wiring.  After trying numerous gates, this is the only one that fits the space (when using extensions) and actually seems quite sturdy.  The problem is that when we went to loosen the ""tamper proof"" hand-wheels a bit in order to adjust the gate, we couldn't do it, and the instructions weren't terribly helpful.  I'm not actually sure how we'll ever get the gate down at this point.  I think we'll just have to kick it down when it comes time to move.",3
The First Years - Natural Comfort Breastpump,"After reading the other reviews I had to comment.  I've been using this one for about four months.  The issue of milk backing up into the chamber is easily solved by cleaning the flaps well so they don't stick.  It only takes a few seconds to run it under hot water.I've used this pump three times a day for months and haven't burned the motor out yet.  I would guess that people who burned the motor out probably let the milk back up into the unit (the instructions warn you not to do that).  Motors and milk don't get along!As far as speed - it's a little slower than a hospital grade pump - that's to be expected.  I can still pump both breasts in less than ten minutes with this unit, though.  I can't imagine buying a pump costing [...] when this one does the job for less than [...]",5

INFANTINO Disney Winnie The Pooh - Soft Infant Carrier ~ 8-23 Lbs,I don't own any other infant carrier but this 1 works as intended. My baby loves hanging out &#60;-- lol.

Pretty Pony Horse Wall Hanging Accessories by Sweet Jojo Designs,"Overall I like these wall hangings, but I felt like I could have done without them. Honestly, to me, the cloth looks a little odd hanging on the wall, so I ended up putting them in different places, eg. hanging one from a curtain rod, or from her dresser on one of the knobs. Overall a good product, but not necessary.",4
"Fisher-Price Newborn Rock 'n Play Sleeper, Yellow","My son did not like sleeping in his crib, but would sleep great either in my arms or in the swing. I did not feel it was safe sleeping while he was in the swing because I have dogs so I basically went without sleep. I purchased this elsewhere on a whim and I love it. My son now sleeps for 4 plus hours straight a night ( before not getting more than 30 minutes). It was pretty easy to put together, everything just snaps in place. The toy is a little strange, but you are not buying it for the toy. I do not worry about when we sleep the dogs can knock it over, it is a wide base frame. I almost did not buy it because I did not think it would work, but it is one of the best baby purchases I made.",5
Tike Tech ATX All-Terrain Stroller,"We just received this as a gift and I must say - ""Thanks-its great!"".  At first we thought we wouldn't use it much because we don't run regularly, but we quickly realized that our 6-month-old baby boy just loves it!  This stroller has actually contributed to my husband's being more active recently. I am active and love going for walks with this stroller.  It is easy to fold and is quite compact. This is now the choice stroller for grandma and grandpa when we drop off the kids for the day.  In addition, this stroller has all the safety features a quality stroller needs such as a five-point harness and an aluminum frame.  It also has great storage space. I was even impressed with the rain reflector. This one is solid and doesn't fall out of position when the wind blows, like other rain covers. Even the set-up instructions were excellent and easy for my husband to follow. For those who want to be more active, try the Tike Tech Roadster.  You and your baby will love it !! We give it 5 stars!!!",5
First Choice Winsor 4-in-1 Crib,"This is a beautiful crib. It is very sturdy and wasn't that hard to put together. The only challenge we had was with the directions. They are shipped in a pocket on the warning label. We thought that perhaps the instructions had not been included in the shipment, but after googling the crib discovered where they were hidden.I'm a little worried about the plastic mechanism that controls the drop front. We will have to see how that holds up over time.Other than that, this is a very quality piece of furniture and I love it!",5
Camo Snap All In One AIO One Size Cloth Diaper by Mommy's Touch,"I love the camo print of this diaper, however it is a bit bulky, and hard to figure out the snaps on this diaper when you are changing a wiggly fussy baby. I wish it was simpler. Overall it is a good diaper, no leaks.",4
Rockabye Mocha Monkey Rocker,"My son loves his Mocha monkey! Even when he is not rocking on it, he will press the buttons to play the different songs. This is a great quality product and adorable.",5
Skip Hop Swipe Baby Wipes Case,love the case. lost one bought another. lost it again bought a new one:) hope i won't loose it again!,5
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray",This is a great purchase as we have used it so many times traveling to new places and also using it at friend's homes who don't have kids. It is easy to clean and works as a nice second high chair when babies visit us!,5
"Honey The Queen Bee Diaper Bag, Black","I just got this diaper bag in black. It is gorgeous and actually is a good size.  Its not super huge like other diaper bags, but is very spacious.  It has lots of pockets to organize baby items like sippy cups, bottles, diapers, wipes, toys, nursing cover, extra set of infant clothes, etc. I love the extras it comes with like stroller straps and a detachable mini clutch which is perfect if you need to run errands in a store and not have a need to bring your entire diaper bag with you.  It is functional but looks very classy. I will be using it for my two babies for the next few years but after they're older and out of diapers, it will serve as an awesome everyday purse or weekender bag. I haven't had this bag for very long so we'll see how the quality of it stands the test of time but so far I love it and am surprised how much I can fit into it for two kids!",4
"Summer Infant Decorative Wood &amp; Metal 5 Foot Pressure Mounted Gate, Brown/Black",Gate fits space perfectly - the pressure mounted system is a little strange - we have two other pressure mounted gates with hard rubber stops - the pressure mount on this gate is not as secure.  My biggest gripe with this gate is the latch - it has such a precise latch piece that if you dont get top and bottom in exact location it wont securely latch - this makes the gate cumbersome in high traffic areas.  Its ok on a sturdy standpoint. I would prefer if the gate was all metal.,3
Philips AVENT Express Food and Bottle Warmer,"This bottle warmer does what it says. It warms bottles. It is as basic in that task as can be. Unfortunately all of the negatives make this thing harder to use than just running a bottle under hot water. I never thought I'd care so much about a bottle warmer.What it really lacks is any thought in its design or development. Everything about it is annoying. The cord is stiff, has nowhere to be coiled, and therefore ends up restricting where the unit can go on the counter, and we've always got a cord flopping around in our way on the counter. It doesn't have a timer, which means I have to set the oven timer. The instructions are lacking important info (details for 4oz, none for 2oz), sending us to the internet for answers. The power button is on the rear of the unit, the temp gauge is on the front.  The stupid light that tells you if it's on, is only on while the unit is actively heating, so it goes on and off for minutes at a time. Unless you happen to be in the kitchen when the heating element kicks on, you won't know if it's on or off. We are constantly leaving this thing on for long periods of time, which means when we go to use it, we have to turn it off, let it cool, then start it up again so we can properly time the heating cycle, according to their directions.UPDATE: We bought a Kindii Kozii and love it. Put bottle in, set timer, walk away. Done. Twice as much, worth every penny.",2
Instant Murals 7 Under The Sea Wall Transfer Stickers - Tropical Fish,I tried transferring these on several different surfaces and it didn't work on any. Wouldn't recommend them unless you have other means of affixing them.,2
Medela Breastmilk Freezing &amp; Storage (*BPA Free) - 80ml Bottles in Retail Packaging #87061 (Pack of 12 Bottles),"Great product , no leaking , no waste perfect size !!!!!!Great for storing and feeding almost any nipple works",5
"Trend Lab Ultimate Diaper Bag, Brown/Blue","I don't return a lot of items to Amazon, but this one I did.  We first ordered this bag in black/avocado, but after two months of saying that it would be shipped, we got word that this color was no longer available.  So then we ordered this in black/tuquoise, thinking it would work.  The color was ok, but the bag itself just didn't work for us at all.  First of all, it was BIG.  When I opened the delivery box, I just couldn't believe how big it was.  I'm all about spacious bags, but this one wasn't even that spacious; it was just big and flat, which leads me to my second complaint about this bag.  It didn't seem very practical.  I couldn't imagine it being very easy access to the things that I would need because it was long and deep, but very skinny.  In the end, this bag just did not work for me.  We ended up returning this bag and getting an Eddy Bauer bag for about ten bucks more that has been great for us.",2
"UPPAbaby Stroller Parent Organizer, Black",Extremely useful. Love it. Don't get the cup holder it does not attach well. Use this instead. Highly recommended. User friendly.,5
"Kolcraft Cozy Soft Cradle Pad, Lily","I bought this for a hand me down cradle i received. It fit perfectly and i was happy to see that it was waterproof. It was thinner than i expected but on the cradle i have it specifically says not to use something more than 2"""" thick and that's what this was so i guess this fits all the requirements... my only complaint is that it seems like there's a lot of air or something trapped inside making it feel kind of like a water raft or something rather than a mattress. It seems like it will do the trick for the short amount of time well be using it but its definitely not perfect.",3
"Malden Scroll Cross Picture Frame, Pewter","I purchased this as a wedding gift, it is nice but kind of nothing speacial.  I was a bit dissppointed.",3
"Re-Play 8 Count Utensils, Aqua, Green, Orange",These forks and spoons are great for our 2 year old. They are the perfect size for her to learn to eat with utensils. The fork prongs are sharp enough to be effective but not sharp enough to be used as a weapon (which is ideal with a feisty toddler!). The spoon is short enough for her to effectively spoon (read: shovel) soup or oatmeal for herself with minimal mess (also ideal with a feisty toddler!). Great purchase and a great value too. I love Re-Play products -- they're the only ones we buy for our kids!!,5
Pickles Forest Friends Embroidered Fleece Baby Blanket with Al Agnew Wildlife Art - Wolf Cubs,"I bought a total of 8! Originally ordered 4, 1 of ea animal (wolf cubs, bear cubs, ducklings and fawn).[ASIN:B001TK31OW Scene Weaver Pickles Forest Friends Embroidered Fleece Baby Blanket with Al Agnew Wildlife Art - Bear Cubs]Upon receiving was BLOWN AWAY how beautiful the colors, outstanding quality and so soft, felt like real chamois. Was lucky to pay so little including shipping but felt badly evident no profits were made from these. Appreciated & estatic will be gifts for 1st grandchild this fall.Others were astounded at how lovely, the quality and the give away clearance prices when I showed these to them. Decided to rush order another 4 (1 of ea animal again for 2nd son's possible future 1st baby).These would make lovely baby shower gifts and other occasions. Doubt anyone wouldn't be very pleased ordering these. GORGEOUS, BEAUTIFUL, LOVE THEM!Thanks again to the manufacturer, seller and Amazon enabling quick search, LOW prices, quick delivery.  All were factory package, ribbon ready for gift giving. I decided to keep Scene Weaver in my favorites list for future.",5
"Mutsy Grow Up Booster Seat, Aqua","I own two of these chairs.  The green one that I own works great.  It secures to the chair wonderfully and my daughter who is 19 months old but very small (only 20Ibs.) fits wonderfully in it.  It is also easy to clean. HOWEVER, the blue one of these that I own began to peel after less than a week of use.  I clean them both with a sponge and mild soap and water.  It is peeling all over even in places that my daughter doesn't rub up against when she's sitting.  It is unsafe and unsightly.",1
"Sassy Baby Food Nurser, Colors May Vary","Wish they were in stores instead of just on-line. These are the best kept secret EVER!  Never a hassle, ever.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","Good nightlight.  The brightness is good (not too bright).  I haven't tested out the timer feature yet.  The stars can be difficult to see clear when the turtle is on the floor, and they may not cover most of the ceiling from on top of a dresser.  It doesn't seem to affect my kids being able to go to sleep (except sometimes they fight over who can play with it).  It has a pretty cool story and star chart included",4
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","I bought 2 of these for my grandsons when I babysit and they were the best thing I ever bought.  They are good quality, they open in an instant, they come with a washable  fitted sheet (for those little accidents) and they also have a travel bag.  My grandkids love them plus I don't have to remake my beds after their naps.  I would definitely recommend these to everyone with kids and grandkids. They also come it pink for the little girls but my granddaughter isn't ready to spend the night yet.",5
Evenflo 60 Count Nursing Pads,"I love these pads because I produce ALOT of milk and they catch a lot. They are easy to tell in the middle of the night if they are filling up before they over flow. They have a gel in them and they are cottony and light and fluffy until they start filling up then very gelly and mushy. Very soft on sore nipples. No adhesive or weird shapes, They're great!",5
Kushies Wash Cloths- Pack of 6,i thought these were gonna be actual cloths...i will specify bathroom cloths in my future cloths...these were furry paper cloths basically...my own fault for not looking into it more to get the product for my needs...would have been great for when my 4 aliens were still babies maybe for wiping drool,2
"Lansinoh mOmma Feeding Bottle, 5 Ounce","I breastfeed but work full time at home, so sometimes need my daughter to take a bottle. She has had trouble with other bottles but doesn't bat an eye when someone gives her this. I was worried that without the Dr Browns thing in the middle it would give her gas or something but we've had no problems",5
Hello Kitty Leather-like Shopper Tote Shoulder Hand Bag,"Its the cutest bag ever I get so many compliments on a daily basis, it's a bit small for my liking but the overall it's superb cute",5
New Boba Wrap in Red with Matching Carrying Pouch : Infant Baby Carrier : Preemie - 18months (Previously Sleepy Wrap),"I do love the wrap, however I wish it had less stretch.  After wearing it for a while or moving around alot, baby starts to slide down into wrap.  I do not have it on loose, he is perfect at first.  But after bending and twisting to say sweep the floor or what have you, it no longer keeps him supported against me.  The wrap doesn't let him fall, but he slides down into the pocket.  So while I love the comfortable feel of this wrap, it doesn't seem to be good of youre doing anything other than walking.  I'm considering either the air 3g, or ergo.  I definitely love wearing him on this wrap...until it starts to sag.  I'm actually going to make my own and see if I can't find a happy medium between this and the no stretch moby that I'm also going to make.  Had I known how simple this was, I would probably have just made it myself.  I would recommend this to someone with a small baby, but not so much over 10lbs or so",4
"Go Anywhere Booster Seat, Blue/Espresso","I loved the five part harness system and pattern on this seat but all in all it was not functional.  The top part of the seat would not stay strapped properly to most seats, the top part where it shuts would also poke my daughter in the head and the sides were so flimsy that she could lean to the side and be hanging in the seat by a thread.  We returned this seat and bought the Eddie Bauer version and like it much better.  It is a much more functional and safe seat.",2
"green sprouts 2 Pack Organic Cotton Mitts, 0-6 Weeks, White","These gloves will be a little too big for most newborns/infants. The product is decent quality and I'm sure I will use them when my baby is a little bigger. However, I gave a lower rating do to the amount of packaging that these two small pair of gloves arrived in. Again...two pair of cotton gloves arrived in a large cardboard box (shoebox size!) with two large plastic type ""pillows"" surrounding them. Were the cotton gloves going to break? A padded envelope would have been fine.",3
"Simple Wishes Hands-Free Breastpump Bra, Pink, XS-L","Before I used this, pumping was pretty awful. I had to keep both hands on the flanges the whole time. Then the bra came... freedom! I play games on my phone, use the laptop, and eat all while pumping. It was hard to get on the first couple of times, but its really easy with a little bit of practice.",5
"Dr. Sears Nibble Tray, Yellow/Green, 12 Months","I send my 1 year old to daycare with this wonderful food tray.  As some other reviews state, it is not leak-proof, but with dry food he stays cleaner anyway.  I'll fill the tray up with avocado, olives, pickles, tomatoes, frozen peas, canned beans, cheese, cheerios, fruit - you name it.  This gets you away from the feeling that you need to send a sandwich every day, and allows you to give your little one a large variety of fruits and vegetables instead.  I'm surprised that some people are saying it's too small for a toddler - remember, their stomach is only as big as their fist - this tray holds plenty of food for your average little one (and I've never even used the dip tray).  *Update - my son is 2 now (yes, I'm so enthusiastic about this, I'm re-reviewing it) and I send him with this tray, sans dip tray, and one extra small serving of yogurt or cottage cheese or a half sandwich on super skinny bread (in a separate container, or course), and he's full.",5
Pearhead Babyprints Photo Frame,"Good quality, it is bigger than i thought, and does not have ink inside, so still need purchase for that.others was good.",4
