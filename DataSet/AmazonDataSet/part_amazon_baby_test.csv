,"So, I put the cover on my new icomfort mattress and it was great. My daughter has an accident on it after a few months (which is very unusual) so I didn't worry about it because it is waterproof. I changed the sheets at 3am and went back to bed. Next morning I notice the mattress smells like urine (just like mattress protector) so I called and asked why. She asked if mattress was wet. I said that at 3am I didn't check if the mattress was wet because the mattress protector is waterproof. She said they aren't guaranteed against smells just water or liquid. I hope they other reviewer actually smelled his mattress instead of just looked at it...Maybe they should call it liquid proof.We'll see how this customer service angle plays out.",2

"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Original, Blue Retro","This is a very good carrier.  I recommend the mesh one with back support if you have the extra $.  I also recommend looking at the Ergo (but kid has to sit facing you. I also recommend looking at the Cybex.  We own all three, I use my mesh Baby bJorn w/back support the most, wife likes the Ergo.  Cybex was a gift but I like it a lot.",5

"Safety 1st OnBoard 35 Adjustable Infant Car Seat Base, Black",i have the Eddie Bauer Travel System from Target and this is the exact same base for the car seat it does say safety first not Eddie Bauer they are exactly the same. i was worried i was not going to be able to get extras. was a really good price and arrived faster than estimated.,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"The champ is great because you don't have to waste anymore money buying expensive refills like the diaper genie.  This one uses regular bags (I use 32 gallon bags).  I did have some problems with the odor, but I think anything you put poop in and let sit for days will have odor so that's inevitable!  Here's some tricks for this Champ:1.  Put an Arm & Hammer Baking Soda box at the bottom of the pail to help eliminate orders.  And the obvious, change the bag every couple days to eliminate the smell... don't expect to leave it there for a week and have it smell like roses!2.  The side straps of the diaper will get caught in the shoot so make sure you roll the diaper really tight and use the straps to hold it together, otherwise your diaper shoot will get clogged.3.  If you're like me, you probably have tons of grocery bags laying around.  Keep a few handy in the nursery and use them to bag the poopy diapers.  Double bagging them helps to eliminate the orders.Hope this helps!",5
Regalo Easy Open 50 Inch Super Wide Walk Thru Gate - White,"Easy to setup, easy to use, and does just what it is supposed to do. Highly recommended to all that need one.",5
Jamaican Stroller Team Bib,"I bought this for a newborn who is Jamaican, Jewish, and Korean.  His father said he liked the gift for his son.  I know US society is supposed to be ""post-racial"" (yeah, right!), but this bib is great because Jamaicans of all kinds of backgrounds could put it on their kids.  I guess bibs are a homogeneous good, but still, I like that families have the option to express ethnic pride through the item.  I recommend this for Jamaican expectant parents all over the Jamaican Diaspora.",4
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,My 1-year-old grandson really loves this.  He is already very fond of music and this allows him to change the sound using all the different combinations available on the cube and he is listening to Mozart while doing so....doesn't get much better than that.  It's very easy for a young child to manipulate and there are no small parts to worry about.  I highly recommend this.,5

"Skip Hop Diaper Satchel, Chelsea Downtown Chic","If you are pondering the Chelsea Downtown Chic for yourself or a gift....Order it now! This bag is amazing quality and stylish to boot. The space inside is enough for me to haul stuff for my 3 boys age 5 and under as well as enough little pockets in all the right places for my phone, wallet, keys, etc. I received the bag and went out that evening just with my mommy friends. I brought the bag as a purse! It is that cute! The real leather also adds a richness that is unexpected in a diaper bag.",5
"Bright Starts Baby's Play Place Playmat, Swingin' Safari","I was looking for something for my newborn that would be fun, safe and comfortable as he grew. This is perfect for the living room, as we're watching tv or in the kitchen. My son loves the music and the toys and I use it as a carry along when visiting others as a sleeping place for the baby. It's much larger than others and I love the way I can enclose it, even though it's not going to totally deter an active/strong baby. Love it.",5
"Fisher-Price Cradle 'N Swing,  My Little Snugabunny","My husband and I received this as a gift from our baby shower! I am not due until November, so I have not put a baby in it yet! However it was really easy to put together, and it has a plug in cord and battery option as well! It seems very sturdy and has a lot of options as far as music, how fast it swings. Remember to always do your research! Read the good reviews and bad!",5

"Bumbo Floor Seat, Aqua","Everyone has one of these, and I know why. They are really handy and very easy to clean. It is definitely a simple item, but solidly made. Once they get about 8 months, they can tip over in it, so be careful. When my little one was younger, though, she was super stable. Great for a seat when you're feeding them.",5

NUK Cook-n-Blend Baby Food Maker,"So I have 2 kids- a 4 yr old and 7 month old. I bought this after researching several makers.I will start by saying this does a great job making baby food. It is easy to use- put the water in as instructed (they DEF NEED to make the water line easier to read though!!), put in your chopped fruits/veg and push the button. When it's done it beeps and you need to grab a measuring cup or mug to reserve the &#34;steaming&#34; water so you can add some back to the food you are then going to puree. Pretty easy to clean. The thing is this does not make much at once. I used I apple and 1 pear together and that was about all I could steam and it made two 4oz serving. It took 17 min to steam the food. So, do the math- In one hour I could make 8 cont. of food. Maybe if I didn't work and have an older child as well I could see making the food this like this but for me it's just not that practical. I can just as easily steam a whole bunch of stuff (or bake) at once then throw it in a blender and have more. The unit itself is also a pretty good size- yet another appliance on the counter.... But if you can commit yourself to making food every other day then this may be perfect! Also it says you can reheat and defrost but I didn't see how that would work as the basket has a piece in the middle that doesn't remove so I don't understand that part and it didn't say anything about it in the directions.",4
"Chicco KeyFit 30 Infant Car Seat, Midori","Get the BRU exclusive Magic model. While the color is an underwhelming shades of brown, the extras you get are worth not having it be as eye caching as other colors. My daughter is now 14 months and just outgrew this by height, not weight (which will be the case for most babies). She's almost 20 lbs & 30"" tall (avg height, but very thin).  We brought her home in this seat at about 6lbs 9oz and 18"" long. She's fit comfortably the whole time and most often than not, falls asleep in the car.The extras you get from the BRU exclusive Magic version:-is an upgraded infant  insert which she used until about 6 mos (we also used it for the Uppa Baby Cruse stroller until the straps fit her better.)-a MUCH longer sunshade. It almost comes all the way down to the opposite base walls --fully shielding baby for the entire life of use!  This alone is worth it!!-the fabric is easily wipe able.-Light weight. I carried this up until final use. Also used the Snap & Go caddy stroller. Also highly recommended.- install is a breeze, both LATCH & belt. Even grandparents can do it.Cons to this seat in general (all models):- manual adjustable harness hieght. Easy enough to do without baby in the seat. And the good part is if you're only using for one baby you'll only have to do this 3 or 4 times.-to buckle the straps and pull and adjust properly, when putting baby in,will take a few motions. Not bad, but something to note if you're looking for something to just snap a go (not sure this even exists)-Magic version specific: it's not eye catching, but it is gender neutral and decent enough to look at. Just guarantees the baby will get all of the attention from passers by.If trying to decide if you should get a carrier or go straight to a carseat...GET A CARRIER. If you ever plan on leaving to house - grocery store (just sit it in the grocery cart, Drs office, bad weather, restaurants (get a booth & sit the seat in it with baby) sleeping or awake baby. Convenience of getting the buckled in and adjusted in doors versus outside in the elements. Get this or another light weight carrier, you won't be disappointed! We dreaded having to let this go. We had one carrier & 2 bases. One for my car, one for hubby  not necessary but both were used daily so it made it much more convenient to set the carrier down in the car, hear the click, and go.",5
"Munchkin Easy-Close Extra Tall and Wide Metal Gate, Dark Grey","Easy to put together.  Latch mechanism works well.  Our favorite gate of the three we tested.  The latch is starting to stick a little making it slightly harder to use.  Otherwise, strong and sturdy even with our growing dog trying to crash into it.  We wish this came with a larger variety of extensions, would have bought it for our larger hallway space if it did.",4
"Fisher-Price Newborn Rock 'n Play Sleeper,  Rainforest Friends","My newborn would only sleep in my arms and the swing. After three weeks, I was desperate for some sleep too. I didn't want him to spend all night in the swing, so I bought the Rock 'N Play Sleeper. This thing is a miracle worker! My son slept in this every night until he was six months old, and he slept soundly and contentedly. I could put him in here awake while I made dinner or washed my hands, and he was happy to sit and stare at the world.While there are no wheels on this sleeper, it's easy to fold and carry up and down stairs. It slides easily on carpeted and hard-surface floors, too.The incline feature of the sleeper combined with its ability to be rocked back and forth made it superior to a bassinet, which we also tried when my son was a newborn. The recommended age for this sleeper is about 0-6 months, which is longer than he could have stayed in a bassinet.The only con for this product is that there is no motor that would keep the sleeper rocking on a timer, like a swing. (It's possible newer models of the sleeper have this feature--I haven't investigated.) You need to manually rock the sleeper back and forth.This is my favorite product we bought during the infant days.",5
Safety 1st 10 Pack Spring n' Release Latches,"I wish I had read the reviews before I bought. Terrible. The screws that they come with cannot get into the wood and when I did get the latch on (after buying new screws), they broke. Wasted too much time with these, but hopefully reviewing will prevent someone else from doing the same.",1
Jeep Liberty Renegade - Traditional Walker,"My husband and I fell in love with this walker from the moment we found out we were having a boy. It is really cute, easy to clean and small enough to take along. The only down fall is that the only toys on it are three buttons on the steering wheel that make noise when pressed. My son loves pressing the buttons and turning the wheel but with nothing else on there his attention is very short lived. It is great if after a few minutes you give him other toys as well to play with while he is in the jeep.",4
"Clek Oobr Booster Car Seat, Blue Moon","Amazon was the cheapest place I found. This is a pricy seat but a breeze to install and my four year old can buckle/unbuckle it herself,  Safety wise it has the highest rating. I bought the color ""shadow."" They have a wide variety of colors with hugh price increase for the bold colors.",5

Ergo Baby BC2EPK1 Galaxy Grey Baby Carrier with Galaxy Lining And LED Safety Reflector Light,We bought this to take our 3 month old to Disneyland.  I wanted something I could feed him in so we wouldn't have to stop and sit down every 3 hours.  It worked great!  He liked it and I was able to feed him while walking around the park and waiting in line!  I also kept him in it when we went on rides too.  Great investment for years to come!,5
"Baby Buddy Toddler Tether, Navy",It was useful in giving my toddler grandson some independence but keeping him close. Not as useful as for an active toddler as a harness item.,3
Lascal KiddyGuard Avant Gate- Black Mesh,"Arrived sooner than expected.  This gate works great.  The only gate we could find which offered the width and security we needed.  We have an unusual staircase and did need to wrap our newel with wood for mounting.  This gives us peace of mind when our little one is visiting. Great product.  Worth the price.  Only reason for not giving 5 stars was Lascal's website, vague about the mounting kit, unable to download specs to verify mounting prior to ordering.  Would buy from this seller again.",4
"Fantasy Furniture Princess Chair, Pink","Quick Delivery, great quality product, beautiful chair!  My niece Loves this Birthday Gift, it was different from all the others she received!",5
Easy Fit One Size Pocket Diapers - Blueberry - Snap,"We bought 1-2 each of different brands of one size all-in-ones and pockets to try as we began cloth diapering our first baby this summer (Happy Heiney, Bumgenius, Babykicks, Thirsties, Marvels,Fuzzibunz) .  I began cloth diapering her at 2 wks old (7 1/2 lbs).  She is very skinny and petite and is only 10 lbs at 3 months old.  Given her size and build, most of the one-size diapers have leaked on us at one point or another, and we have come to rely on Thirsties duo hemp prefolds wraps but these one-sizers fit the best and have amazing features.  As she gets a little bigger, I will switch mainly to these.  They dry faster than any of our other pockets or all in ones, the minky interior and theo uter PUL is ssoooo soft.  This is the softest PUL I have come across.  The insert agitates out--no pulling gross inserts out before washing:)  Plus--the patterns are the cutest and most original.  Finally, it comes with a fleece liner.",5

"Motorola Additional Camera for Motorola MBP36 Baby Monitor, Brown with White","I was nervous about adding a second camera, I am not good at electronics! This was a simple thing to do....yet it took me 2 attempts to do it! All you do is plug it in, turn the camera and the monitor on and push this sync button on the camera. First time I did it nothing happened - but this is me we are talking about! I am jinxed! Second attempt worked! It is so nice, she can  nap in 2 different rooms now and I don't have to move the camera around!",5
"Skip Hop Tubby Bath Toy Organizer, Orange",This product is great. Big enough to hold a kitchen sink and dries out quickly due to being made from neoprene. It drains well and sticks great to our tile tub walls (so long as you try and avoid the grout). I appreciate that the bag can be removed from the wall without taking off the mounting bracket (which is not permanent but sticks well as mentioned) and that the knobs that hold the bag onto the mounting bracket have hooks so I have a place for my bath poofy.,5
"Seven Everyday Slings, Size 4, Black Magic","I followed instructions exactly on how to select your size. I measured myself with a measuring tape and selected my size of sling. When I got it, the sling fit me but there was no extra room to allow for baby. The sling is not stretchy at all so I couldn't even stretch it to try and get him in there. My sister even tried to help me get the baby in and we couldn't. He just wouldn't fit and he was only two months old.",1
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"I used this sling for both of my babies, (0-&gt; 2.5yrs). We had a front backpack style which was good for about 3 months, until the weight of the baby started to make my back ache.The best thing about this sling, besides the fact that the kids loved riding in it, is that it folds up into a reasonably size bundle that fit in my diaper bag. So as the kids aged, and wanted to walk on their own I could just toss this carrier in the diaper bag for when they got tired. Also with the kid riding either in front or on your hip, they are very accessible, so that you can hand them something, like a bottle or a bit of food when you are on the go. (Say like walking around at the Zoo.)I must admit I liked the hip carry position best, it mimic's having my arm under their butt, and holds them close.Anyway its reasonably priced, you'll get your use out of it, (unlike the front only carriers, which as I mentioned aren't good for very long, or the backpack carriers, which while are good for that heavy load, don't pack up and so aren't with you when you need them.)",5
Playtex Baby The First Sipster Spill-Proof 7 OZ Cup 2 Pack: Boy Colors,"We bought just about every sippy cup available at Walmart & Target trying to find one our son would take to and that wouldn't spill. Just about all sippy cups have some sort of valve. So it came as no surprise that these had valves too. But at least these are easy to clean with a nipple brush. Not a lot of crevices in the lid that are hard to clean either. Like I said, with a nipple brush we were able to clean the valve and the spout. We loved that the handles were attached to the lid so they were ALWAYS in the right position. We never had a problem with them leaking. Our son used to throw them on the floor from his high chair and they never spilled and the valve NEVER popped out. We had no problems with the spout cracking, but then again we never put our bottles or sippy cups in the dishwasher...even if they say dishwasher safe.",5
Cherry Tomato Sugar Sweetie Certified Organic Seeds,"Wow! I never do this. I guess you can say I am new to gardening. I am trying indoor gardening for a hobby. Someone gave me seeds to germinate. I was about to give up and wait for warmer weather. I got these tomato seeds as well as two other types from you and in just 2 day's they started to sprout! All my hope has returned and I can not wait to see how far I can get with the seeds I got, and the system I am using.Thanks for the healthy seeds, they gave me a healthy outlook.",5

"Nuby 2 Pack No-Spill Flip-It Cup, Colors May Vary, 10-Ounce","These cups leak in two places, both from the air flow valve in the cap and all around the top. It's not impossible to get the straw back through the flip top after cleaning, but it's not terribly easy each time either. Within an hour after first washing the cup and helping my son learn how to use the straw top, there were milk spots, puddles and drops all over his high chair, the floor, my pants (he had sat on my lap), and his clothes. I actually would have been far happier if it had leaked from the straw! That I could understand, but how hard should it be to screw it on and go? I've played with how tight I twist it and I'm sure I'll continue to in hopes I can minimize the leakage as much as possible. But all in all, it just shouldn't be this complicated.The straw does take some practice, too. I tried it first myself. It's straw shaped, but you have to bite or press your teeth along the valve in the straw in order to get fluid. Not a bad design at all.My hope is I'll find ""the sweet spot"" and be able to get some real use out of the cup. We'll see.",2
Ameda Gel Pads - 1 pack - 2 pairs,"After being given some Soothies at the hospital, I was looking for a product that would last more than a day. I read that these gel pads without the fabric backing would last 6 days.I was very disappointed with this product.  They are very small, barely cover the essential areas.  After wearing, they cup the wrong direction. They wouldn't stay in place.I called Ameda customer service and they were not helpful. Disappointed in wasting my money on this product.",1

"The First Years 2 Pack Soothie Infant Pacifiers, Colors May Vary","When I first bought these they were great, until my son almost died because of one of these.My 6month year old son almost died if it wasn't that I heard him making a strange coughing sound from his crib. When I arrived he had the ENTIRE pacifier in his mouth and was vomiting. The vomit had no where to go because the pacifier was all the way into his mouth. He always grabs and tries to put it in his mouth but since the the whole pacifier is flexible he must of bent it and pushed it in his mouth. I took it out and put him on my lap facing the ground and he was fine, but if I hadn't heard him and arrive in a matter of seconds I would be hunting down the creators of this pacifier instead of reviewing it cause he would of died without a doubt.They should take this product off the market, or make it less flexible and a bit bigger. I'm going to inform the manufacturer.Don't take the chance as the purpose of pacifiers is to soothe your child, not choke him. You should have peace of mind of putting him in crib and not worry about him dying because of a pacifier.YOU WERE WARNED.",1
Fisher-Price Comfy Time Bouncer,"This seat was the reason I was able to take a shower for the first 8 months of my daughter life! I strap her in, turn it on, and she's happy for at least 20 minutes! Love the vibrating feature and batteries last a long time (and I ALWAYS forget to shut it off!)",5

It fit on the counter next to the sink, in the kitchen sink and now we use it in the bathtub. It is really a great tub and affordable. Don't waste your money on the tubs with all the fancy gadgets all you need  is this, a rubber ducky and a cup to rinse off the soap.",5
Lamaze Tug &amp; Play Activity Knot Take Along Toy,"This toy is great.  My grandson got this toy when he was seven months old.  He is totally ""hypnotized"" by all the colors and sounds the toy makes even after having it for a month.  It is his favorite toy.  He learned to crawl by going after this toy when it was just outside his reach.  He uses it for entertaining, wrestling, throwing, and any other thing that comes to his mind.  Don't even think about taking it away from your child  until he/she is ready to give it up (and that's not often!).  The Lamaze Push and Pull is stimulating for kids mentally and physically.",5
"Fisher-Price Kick and Play Piano Gym, Discover 'N Grow","My 3 month old son loves this toy. It will occupy him for up to a half hour at a time. My biggest complaint is the toys that come with the gym. They are hard plastic, which is not ideal for a 3 month old who just bats his hands at them. If I took them off the gym, they couldn't do &#34;double duty&#34; as a teething/ stroller toy. The lion that comes with the set doesn't do anything (doesn't rattle, squeak, turn, etc) - it is just a lion made of hard plastic.",4
Dream On Me 3&quot; Foam Play Yard Mattress,"I was worried about the size. I bought a Safety First Playard (Jordan) and I didn't want any gaps between the mattress and the playard. The playard was nice and sturdy but even when it says to not add any mattresses or anything else, the surface was a little hard for what I wanted it for. I want my baby to sleep on this at night so he can be in my room without having to share a bed, which seemed more dangerous. USING IT IS EVEN MORE DANGEROUS THAN PUTTING THE BABY ON MY BED. The mattress makes the bassinet surface a lot higher (by the 3 inches) therefore BLOCKING the mesh part of the bassinet and if the baby moves close to the sides his face would be blocked by the vinyl part that is non-breathable. As soon as I noticed this, I decided to not use it. Bad thing, I got rid of the box that it came in so the item is now non-returnable because if I want to return it I have to find a box big enough to fit the mattress. Even the largest moving box is not large enough so I didn't use it and I can't return it. I guess I will use it for naps in the living room when he is older as I'm stuck with it. The UPS people were very rude about scheduling or helping me with a pickup and wrapping, it's a shame that Amazon uses them for deliveries and pick ups.",1
Rocking Moses Basket Stand Antique Black,"I registered for, and received, this Jolly Jumper Rocking Bassinet Stand, to be used with the bassinet that was included with my Uppababy Vista. While there is an ""official"" bassinet stand for the Uppababy Vista bassinet, it's roughly 3 times the cost of this stand, and I wasn't sure I wanted to spend so much on something that would likely only be used for a few weeks.Putting the stand together wasn't too difficult, although I wouldn't say I was entirely pleased with the assembly. The only tool you will need, that is not included, is a Phillips-head screwdriver. A small Allen wrench is included with all of the screws. The instructions were simple to follow (however, be very careful to note that when attaching the legs to the top bars, they need to be oriented a specific way; the instructions include a little diagram illustrating this, but it's easy to overlook). I was displeased to find that not all of the pieces lines up very well. For instance, one of the legs ended up at an off-angle to the bottom piece, because the pilot holes were not drilled correctly (see the picture I've attached). I also had a problem with a layer of wood starting to peel up around one of the pilot holes after putting in the screw (again, see the picture I've attached). I also noticed that some of the black paint was chipping off in small areas (although, since I have the black stand, I just used a Sharpie to fill those chips in). Once together, it felt sturdy enough to do the job, although the fit and finish of the piece makes it very obvious that this is NOT an heirloom quality piece, by any stretch of the imagination.Once assembled, I placed the Uppababy Vista bassinet into the stand, and immediately became concerned. First, the opening is quite a bit longer than the bassinet, and a little bit wider. And then, I noticed that the depth of the stand (from the top of the rails to the crossbeams/canvas below) was A LOT more shallow than the bassinet. This meant that the sides of the bassinet collapsed inward, making it appear entirely unsafe to use (it seemed like a serious SIDS risk). I was all ready to come on here and write a negative review (which I see has already happened for this very issue, by another reviewer on a different Amazon listing for this same stand in a different color), discouraging others from using this stand for the Uppababy Vista bassinet -- but instead did a little research, and found a solution! If you pull up the mattress pad, and the liner from the bassinet, exposing the board sandwiched between the bottom liner and the inner liner, you'll see two metal bars with straps and rubber covers on the sides, which can be pushed out to be secured by four plastic snaps/holders (see attached picture). Doing so forces the sides of the the bassinet to become rigid, and stops the fabric lining from collapsing inward. This still leaves the issue of the opening being larger than the bassinet... but I may modify it to move the curved plastic straps inward to make it more secure.The stand does not rock a ton, but I don't think I'd want it to rock much more than it does anyway. It will require someone to continually rock it back and forth, with a hand or foot, and when you release it stops rocking almost instantly. The slope of the rocking legs is gentle enough that it does not rock too far forward or back, which is also great.In sum, I think this is a decent choice for the Uppababy Vista bassinet. It's very affordable, compared to the alternative. And it looks to be secure enough to do the job. Fit and finish is poor, and this isn't something I'd hang onto to pass down some day. I'd even be surprised if it held up to being broken down and reassembled for a second child. But, at this price, for something with a very short useful life, those are things I'm willing to accept.",4

"Epic Designs Wall Art Wall Sayings, Christopher Robin","I ordered this item and received it, but the author was missing. I really would have liked to put the line  -Christopher Robin  on the quote but I never received it.  The quote is on my wall, minus the author line :(",4
SwaddleDesigns Ultimate Receiving Blanket - Little Stars - Navy,"I bought this swaddle design receiving blanket b/c of the cheetah pattern, I thought it'd be very cool and fashionable when I wrap my baby in this cool blanket when going out. But when I opened the package, I was quite disappointed. First there was a very plasticky smell, and the blanket was thick and rough to the touch. I thought it might get better after washing, but it didn't.Maybe I'm too used to the Aden & Anais swaddle blankets which I think are very soft to the touch, I find it hard to swaddle my baby in this. The size is good (very big), so I'll have to think of some way to put it to use, but definitely not for swaddling my baby",2
(1) Cresci Products Window Wedge (2 Per Pack) WHITE color,Bought these for my kids' windows on the 2nd story... they work well enough and get the job done but they were not as sturdy as I thought they would be.  Keeping them because they do keep my kids from opening the window to far.  The Velcro just doesn't stick as well as I thought it should have.,4
"American Red Cross Ultra Strong Metal Cabinet and Drawer Safety Latches, 4-Pack","Contrary to some other reviews, we did not find these hard to install.  Installed them in the drawers of our toddler's bedroom dresser.  It takes a few tries to get used to opening the drawers once installed, but after a little practice I now find it pretty easy.",4
Bumkins 3 Pack Waterproof SuperBib,We love the bumkins bibs.  They have been the perfect size for our peanut sized 18 month old.  Great coverage.  Clean up well.  This is the 2nd set we've purchased and we continue to use and love them all!,5
Safety 1st Cling Sunshade 21&quot; wide - 2 Pack,For the price it's not bad. Easy enough to put on and stays on well. I wasnt impressed by the amount of shading it dose. Also edges are extremely rough cut and not straight or smooth.,3
"Dr. Brown's Natural Flow Cleaning Brush, 4 Pack","I bought this after my son's sippy looked like a """"snow globe"""" and his straw was turning black.  The brushes are small enough to fit into the smallest of places and edges.  I even used this for my own cups to get the residual coffee out of the nooks and crannys.",5
PumpEase Classic Collection hands-free pumping bra - Verry Cherry - M,"I loved this bra, until I used it. Unfortunately, I think I bought the wrong size. I followed the instructions for sizing, but I think this might only apply to women with medium and smaller breasts. If you have larger than a C cup, I would recommend sizing up! Other than the sizing being off, the product was well-made, super cute, and felt great.",4
DEX Products Sound Sleeper SS-01,I was disappointed with the product. First it doesn't have white noise and its not very loud at all. If you are buying to help block out other noise for your baby to sleep I would not recommend this. If its for an older child to have some smoothing sounds to sleep with than its fine.,2
"Fridababy The Windi Gas and Colic Relief,  10-Count","After trying NUMEROUS items to cure my babies gas (gas drops, colief, gripe water, zantac, bicycle legs, massage) I found the windi.  The fact is once the gas is in the intestine, no oral product is going to work to release it.  These poor babies are getting so gassy and it makes them so uncomfortable. My LO suffers a lot of times at night. ( i think the digestive system slows and he isn't able to pass the gas as well) Especially at 3 AM.I will rub baby oil on his tummy and work the gas from the right side down to the left side (that is the way the intestines run in infants) I can feel little gas bubbles moving when i do this especially on the left side.Once I put in the windi, WATCH OUT, lol. Sometimes it just needs to be placed for a second or two or the belly rub and insert repeated. But it hasn't failed me yet! Most all the gas comes out and usually followed by a bowel movement.  I think its good to get the bowel movement because most of the gas is usually in front of the bm.  I then will wash out the windi and boil it for 7-10 minutes, It says to discard but at the price...i cant afford it! I usually keep a diaper under baby and a wipe on the peepee so i don't get sprayed!Hope this hels all your little ones out there!",5
Munchkin High Capacity Drying Rack with Deluxe Bottle Brush - Green,I love the functional shape of the product but when it came in I was suprised by how flimsy it seemed. Hope it works great though. Bought this as a gift for a friend.,4
Infant Optics DXR-5 2.4 GHz Digital Video Baby Monitor with Night Vision,"I have been using this monitor for about a year now, and have recommended it to everyone I know who is having a baby.  The product is very nicely priced compared to other camera systems.  I have a two story house and my daughter lives on the top floor in the back and am able to go out well into my front yard without any issues.  The camera is very clear and I LOVE the night vision. I'm actually able to take pictures of the video monitor on my cell phone and they are still clear in both day and night.  I have not used any other camera system so I can not compare quality, but for less that $100 this camera is amazing.  The best feature is the auto screen off (VOX on/off) that after a certain amount of quiet time the screen blacks out until noise is detected.  This makes my room stay dark at night and is a good indication if you can't be right by the camera all the time.  I recently took it camping and was able to set it up inside and see the screen flicker on if my daughter woke up.  You are able to set up four camera but I do wish the cameras were a little cheaper (one camera is as much as the whole system) so I haven't tried this feature. This unit does cause interference if you are an Xbox gamer using Turtle Beach headphones (which probably doesn't apply to many of you but for those it does the interference is annoying but manageable if you move the two systems around), but I don't even know its on with other WiFi using electronics.  This also has a one year hassle free warranty (my unit recently stopped working and they sent a new one out very quickly even before receiving my old one) which is pretty good and the customer service representatives are so very nice and friendly.  If you are looking for a good quality camera for not a lot of money, this is definitely the one to buy!!!!!",5
Annabel Karmel Fill and Freeze Puree Pops,"My 10 month old daughter is a picky eater, but eats the entire popsicle when I make them.  I make mine out of pureed fruits, with no added juices or sweeteners.  It's been a great way to get her to eat, and they are the perfect size.  I do get a little nervous b/c her face around her mouth gets super cold and red but I guess if it bothered her she wouldn't eat it.",5
P'kolino Chalk Table and Benches - Cobalt,"my mother got this as a birthday present for my six year old son. I have seen maybe 20 plus chalk board tables before ordering this and I am glad we got this one. both my son and 2 year old daughter use this everyday. i love the blue color, the chalk writes really well on the blue chalk board and cleans great with damp wash cloth. there are some nice storage inside the board. we had it for two weeks now, so far pretty good.",5
"North States Supergate Easy Close Metal Gate, White","The gate came bent ever so slightly, but enough that it could not close.  Wish I had figured that out before I installed the thing.  Of course, Amazon refunded my money easily.",1
Graco SnugRider Infant Car Seat Stroller Frame,i love this concept and this stroller did the trick but i would pay a little bit more for the better built one if you know what i am talking about... after 5 months the front wheel would get stuck and stopped turning. we used it a lot for walks and it didn't handle the sidewalks too well... overall i was very happy.,3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Love the Diaper Champ.  I had planned to get the Diaper Genie, but after I read the reviews, the Diaper Champ won out!  I love the fact that the Diaper Champ accepts any kind of bag, and you don't have to purchase specific bags.  That's way too much of a headache and expense that I don't need.  It's also super easy to use one-handed which is important with a squirmy infant either in your arms or on the changing table.  It took me a few minutes to learn how to change the bag, but that, too, is easy once you figure it out.  We haven't had a problem at all with the smell, but we do wipe it out with Clorox wipes every so often just to make sure.  This is one of those baby items I wouldn't want to do without.",4
DEX Products Baby Wipes Warmer,"I absolutely hated this product!  My sister-in-law warned me about the ""issues"" with this product but I had read the box which says - No Drying or Browning of the wipes- and felt I should give it a try (I liked the night light option).  Well, I found that each time I removed wipes for use, about 3-4 of them were too dry to use and I had to throw them away.  I even tried to use the foam insert from the Prince Lionheart warmer but that didn't help either.  Finally I tossed the thing and bought another brand warmer and so far so good.  The moral of my story - don't believe the hype (on the box) and don't buy this warmer!",1
KidCo Door Knob Lock - 2pk - Clear,"I have a very inquisitive two year old who has managed to outsmart almost every door knob cover device we've tried ... except this one.  this is 200% better than the Safety First covers we first purchased.  It works easily enough for adults, but my little guy can't figure it out, which I love!!  My 8 year old girl has gotten her pinky pinched a couple times, but nothing serious so I'm ordering a second set.",5
Animal Planet Bath Time Kneeling Pad,Cool design and very helpful verse kneeling on the hard floor.With it small and portable easy to take on trips to Grandmas or even store under the bathroom sink verse other systems that basically require them to be out all the time.,5
myBaby Soundspa Lullaby Sound Machine and Projector,This is wonerful! The only upgrade feature I would like to see is a remote control to go with it then I could turn it off from the doorway instead of going all the way into the nursery. Great device and highly recommend it! Little One loves it!,5
Lambs &amp; Ivy Hello Kitty Rug 32''x32'',"Our daughter is too young to even notice, but everyone in our family is envious.  I just hope she will appreciate it when she get's older.  Note:  There are other items on eBay to match, like fan blades and a wall clock.",5
"Inglesina 2011 Swift Ergonomic Stroller, Basilico","We purchased the Inglesina Swift instead of a larger stroller, because of storage space constraints. I've been very happy with the purchase. The stroller has served us well even when our baby was only a few weeks old. It is more solid and adaptable than a regular umbrella stroller; the reclining back is useful for tiny babies with no head control. For babies that young, I recommend using the stroller in combination with the Boppy Noggin NestBoppy Noggin Nest Head Support, Brown Wheels. It rolls smoothly, even over rough ground, and turns as well as much more expensive strollers. You can steer with one hand. My 6 foot husband likes that the handles are higher than other strollers. I don't find them too high for me, even though I am just slightly over 5 feet tall.I gave this item 3 stars instead of 5 because the opening and closing of the stroller, as well as the reclining, feel clumsy and can't be operated with one hand. For the price, I think that this is a worthwhile trade off for the otherwise overall quality of the stroller.",3
"Summer Infant Deluxe Piddle Pad, Black, 2 Pack",Great..fits perfect..Highly recommend! Especially when going out and about while potty training..I would think a smart buy for infants too.,5
Dreambaby Super Toy Hammock and Toy Chain,I bought this to store my stuffed animals in. I didn't like the mounting hardware and it was hard to put up so that critters wouldn't fall out. I love the chain! I would probably buy this again.,5
"Medela Quick Clean Breastmilk Removal Soap, 6 Ounce","This stuff is magic! If you have a pump, you need this stuff!The milk residue disappears instantly!I've tried putting the parts in the dishwasher and in the steam clean bags, but this product cleans better, faster and is more convenient!",5
"Munchkin Deluxe Bottle Brush, Colors May Vary",Love this brush for those deep and hard to reach areas in my sons' bottles. And really like the suction cup so it can just stand by the sink!,5
"Edushape 4&quot; Sensory Balls, Set of 4, Solid",These were fun to play with when my daughter was young - we even used them when we were teaching her colors!  She liked them because they were easy to pick up for her small hands!,4
Furniture Wall Straps (Set of 2),I have a very curious 2 year old and I was worried a heavy 6ft cabnet would topple over onto her...put the straps in and I am a little more at ease!  Easy to install - just cinch it tight when both ends are secure!,5
"Carters Keep Me Dry Flannel Bassinet Pad, Green/Yellow","I used these for my baby 28 years ago, and when I my grandsons were born (twins), I realized that they aren't available in the stores anymore.  I was happy to find them at Amazon.  They wash well, lay flat and come in various sizes.",5
"The First Years 1 Pack Breastflow Bottle, 9 Ounce","The way the nipple was designed made it difficult for my son to get any milk out. Also, the nipple kept collapsing and the bottle leaked!This was a total waste of money.",1
"Playtex Diaper Genie Elite Diaper Disposal Pail, White","I've never seen an expectant mother NOT break out in smiles when she gets one of these!!!  So, I was thrilled to be able to snag this nice tall one for a new mother of twins.  She was ecstatic! These little gadgets are pretty brilliant really, and totally smooth the transition into motherhood with keeping all the baby smells the""good baby smells."" And they're more hygenic.  Very cool.  Totally recommend for the new mothers and fathers (or grandparents) in your life.",5
"Aden by aden + anais Muslin Crib Sheet, Oh Girl!",The giraffe print is adorable! i have never used a muslin ANYTHING before though and it seems somewhat flimsy feeling to me :/ babykins isn't here yet so we haven't field tested the sheet- I am hoping they are durable! I will say this sheet is super soft which is great.,4
"Graco Nautilus 3-in-1 Car Seat, Matrix","Graco does it again! Without going completely broke I am confident that my 3 yr old son is comfortable and SAFE in this seat. He loves it! Mommy loves how easy it is to clean as well as secure in any vehicle quickly and confidently. Even my husband commented how easy it is for him to install this seat (whoa.) When it came out that kids are safer in a 5 point harness longer than the 40 pounds his previous seat allowed, I was on the hunt for a new one. Awesome price for a great product that will last and meet the Graco standards that have seen us all through so many generations!",5
Fisher-Price Rock 'n Play Portable Bassinet,"This product was pretty expensive, but a complete waste of money. Each of our 2 month old twins tried it and hated it. The rocking motion was uncomfortable for the babies (we would have to pack them in with rolled up receiving blankets to keep them from shifting and wobbling around - not a great idea). We waited and tried it again at 4 months when they had more neck and body control and they still didn't like it and then at 6 months our kids were way too big. The only aspect they enjoyed was the mirror inside. I wish we had returned it right away!",2
Samsung Wireless Video Security Monitoring System,Good picture and works well. Used by first time parents.Helps the first time parents get a good night sleep.,5
Summer Infant Deluxe Comfort Booster- Tan,"loved the new booster chair, if you expect to be the size of a high chair you will not like it. much smaller seat and tray but works well strapped to our kitchen chair. does not take all the room of  a regular high chair.and my one year old grandson loves to be at the table with  us for our meals.",4
"The First Years 6 Pack Ziploc Sippy Cup, 7 Ounce","I am sooooo disappointed in these cups!! They looked so nice & being made by Ziploc was a plus.  How wrong I was!! My daughter loves pulp free OJ but somehow it always ends up clogging the holes even after i stab a toothpick thru them (the take & toss cups never clog with same OJ). The cups leak like sives & FYI Ziplock, it is NOT spill proof if it has to be upright to not leak or spill, if that was the case every cup would be spill proof lid or no lid.  Just another product that makes me wonder who (if anyone) tested these before mass production?!?! EPIC FAIL Ziploc!!!",1
Best Bottom Cloth Diapers - Snap - Orange Sherbet,"A bit too expensive for what kind of diaper it is, and it leaves indents on my babys legs even though it is not too tight. it is a alright product but it could be better.",4
"Prince Lionheart Corner Guards, Chocolate Brown","I put these on some sharp corners after my kids went to bed one night.  When they woke up, they did finally discover them, and they picked at them a little bit, trying to figure out what they were.  But the cushions held strong.  Of course, my kids are a little older (the young one is 15 months), so they mostly understood me when I told them to stop playing with them.  But the most important thing is that these work!  My kids haven't hurt themselves on these corners at all since I put these on.  I wish I'd bought them sooner!  They are very thick and cushy.  And the brown color is a plus.  Of course, you're gonna notice them if you look right at them, but it's not going to attract attention.  I can imagine that a dog would be very attracted to these and would probably try to chew it to pieces, but I luckily don't have a dog, so I don't have that problem.",5
Sunshine Kids Travel Pal Organizer,"This has been a pretty big life saver for me in the car.  It fits perfectly between my two car seats and the girls can still reach their sippy cups as well as the book or toys that get stashed in it.  It also fits small packages of tissues, wipes and some small garbage bags... all things I like having on hand in my car.  My only complaint would be that the sides are not really strong enough to withstand the continual abuse that comes from being accessed daily by two toddlers.  All in all, I would purchase again.",4
Regalo Easy Open 50 Inch Super Wide Walk Thru Gate - White,"We put this in our travel trailer. We have large dogs and crates took up too much floor space. The gate went inside the 2 door openings of the washer dryer closet. We put both expansions on one side so the gate would work in the other opening. We had to add a 4x4 post on one side as it was not quite large enough. We can hang water buckets from the top rail of the gate. This worked great for what we wanted it for: it was inexpensive, easy and no permanet alterations to our trailer. I will say it is NOT a sturdy gate. If you are looking for something for the top of your stairs for your kids or are worried about the look of it, this may not be the gate for you. You get what you pay for. This is an inexpensive gate, don't expect designer quality; but it worked for what we wanted.",4
Angry Birds Vertical Lunch Bag with Top Flap,Good quality and a big hit with my kindergartener. Can be easily wiped out which is great with little kid lunches.,5
"Honeysuckle Breast Milk Storage Bags, 75 Ct (3 Boxes of 25 pcs)","Love the fact that these bags are biodegradable!  Helps me to feel more okay with tossing the bags after each use.  However, we've had several bags that have had leaky bottoms as soon as milk has been poured into them :(  Doesn't make me happy after having to work to get the milk.  Other than that, we have liked these bags - especially the price.",3
Maclaren MX3 Stroller - Citrus Lime,"I use this as a regular stroller for my 7 1/2 mos old and my husband uses it for jogging with her, we both love it. I have quite a few strollers, but this one is the best so far. It's so light-weight but still sturdy - doesn't feel like it's going to fall apart if you hit a bump hard, like many other lightweight strollers/joggers. It folds in half, compact enough to fit into the hatchback of my small suv without having to remove any wheels - but for a smaller car/trunk, it may be more challenging. It is somewhat wide, so it can take some getting used to in terms of maneuvering it.There are really only two drawbacks that I've found - 1)The basket at the bottom isn't open, so you have to unsnap it to get your item(s) in there, and re-snap it to close, but I guess it helps when you're using it for purposes of jogging, preventing things from falling out, and 2) the top cover doesn't extend far enough to really shield the baby from the sun if she's sitting upright, so I've ordered a stroller shade to remedy that issue. Those issues are minor though, I'm really happy we got this, recommend it to anyone looking for a lightweight, sturdy jogging stroller.",5
Diaper Dekor Plus Diaper Disposal System,"This was the third diaper pail I have purchased in a little over a year.  I have to say, I think that it is my favorite so far.  Both of the others I had purchased were not worth the money... they were either not easily cleaned, or did not block enough of the smell!  This one is a better combination of both.  I like that there is a lever on the bottom you can step on so you dont even have to touch anything if you don't want to.  It is also nice because there is really no chance of making a mess, the top opens and goes right into the bag.  The refills last FOREVER... and I also feel like these bags take a while to fill up.  You can cram a lot in there until it's time to cut off the bag and tie it up. I would definitely recommend this over the rest of the pails!",4
"Cosco High Back Booster, Ava",Not real sturdy but comfortable to travel with and check through luggage.  It doesn't have any bells and whistles and it's just what I was looking for.  Can't beat the price for a second car seat!,4
"Britax Pavilion G4 Convertible Car Seat, Cowmooflage","I loved this carseat because of the safety features.  If I were to design a carseat, this is how I would have made it.  It's so easy to install and adjust to your child.  I got this to grow with my 7.5 mo daughter so I ordered the Cub Pink and omg it's so cute!!! It's a little darker than the picture, but I like it better than out-there-in-your-face pink.To adjust the height of the straps, all you have to do is move the back panel up and down using the handle.  No fuss, no rethreading straps; just simple.  I thought this was genius!  I love that it clicks when you tighten it and each time you buckle the seat.  I like knowing my child is locked and loaded.I will order this again for my next child and after showing this off to grandma, pretty sure she's gonna get one for her car too.  So great!!!",5
"Safety 1st Bath Cradle, Blue","My baby is two months old and LOVES this bathtub seat.  She will just sit in it and play and splash.  It allows me to put her in it and watch her but have my hands free so I can wash her.  My only complaint is I wish it was a little bigger because I think she is going to out grow it a little.  Also, she does slide down in it and I have to pull her back up but that isn't a big deal at all.  It is great!",4
"Sassy Baby Food Nurser, Colors May Vary","Item was as shown, although the first shipment got lost? Baby Haven re-shipped the item and I received it without incident.",5
"Chicco Smart Support Backpack, Red","When we first got this, I was really worried about the visor being so tall.  Well, it's tall, but it does fold down.  You have to unclip it and push it back.  Also, the front bumper does fold down.  There are two buttons under the fabric.  Then you pull the bumper forward (it isn't easy the first time) and push it down.  You may want a second person to help you.  I found this out from contacting Chicco, because the information was not in the manual.  This is important if you need to store the backpack in the overhead area on an airplane.  Also, the top clip cuts across my chest is a strange place.  I am short, so that maybe the issue.  I'm going to see if my tailor can move it up a little bit.  This may seem like a lot of exceptions, but it is a good piece of equipment to have.  It was a great option to have on our vacation to Chicago and surrounding areas.  Sometimes a stroller was good, but other times a backpack was the way to go.",4
"Munchkin Two Snack Catchers, Colors May Vary","These snack cups are AWESOME! I can put all sorts of small snack items (dried fruit, crackers, cookies, etc) in here, and my toddler can't get the lid off to make a mess. He can get his hand in all the way to the bottom to get the last few pieces (a problem I've had with other snack containers). Yes, if you have small crumbs and your child turns the cup upside down and shakes, you might have a little mess. However, it wasn't that big of a problem for me - just make sure you have fresh, whole pieces of your snack.",5
"Ulubulu Personalized Pacifier Clip, Lady Bug","Our daughter went through a phase she enjoyed her pacifier, so I got this clip, turns out she's not so into it anymore. I digress, it was secure, sturdy and colorful. What more do you want?",5
Pkg of 20 Travel Disposable If Lost Wristbands for Emergency Notification,"Wrote on the back with a Sharpie and it stayed on all day and even in the pool. Never got lost but made me feel better that they'd have my cellphone number in case we got separated. Thought it was a bit pricey though although my one child (age 4) tried with all his might to get it off, it never did :-)",5
Starlight 5 Piece Crib Set,"For our first born, I spent an arm and a leg for a Wendy Bellissimo set.  It was worth it because it was the most beautiful collection.  However, it was still expensive.  I couldn't believe it when I found Wendy Bellissimo collections at Babies R Us for a fraction of the cost.  We're having a boy this time around, so we were very excited to find this Starlight collection.  And for the price that we paid for our first crib set, we can buy the crib set, plus all the matching accessories.  And as far as I can tell, the quality is the same.  If you loved Wendy Bellissimo before, you are really going to love it now.",5
Combi Flare Lightweight Stroller in Mandarin,"I am a stroller junkie and my husband will tell you that the last thing that we needed was another stroller!  I needed something for an upcoming Disney trip that would accomodate my 3 year old and I was not satisfied with the umbrella strollers out there.  This is just the thing!  She can hop in and out as needed, but I also love the option to recline if she should happen to fall asleep.  I have been using this around town with my 9 month old and I will now make this my ""go to"" stroller.  It folds up very compact and is effortless to maneuver.  After using it himself, my husband now sees why I needed another!!",5
Arm's Reach Natural Original Co-Sleeper,"I love our Co-sleeper!!! We have twin boys and they are 13 weeks and just now transitioning into their cribs. They have sleep in the co-sleeper since coming home and it is perfect! The original size is great for twins or for one baby who is bigger. The weight limit is 30 lbs. for the higher level which sold us as the pack n'plays are only 15 lbs. I can't recommend this enough, it truly has been a lifesaver to just reach over and have access to a baby. You can also buy lifts, but our bed is pretty tall and we didn't need them.",5
Wubbanub Infant Plush Toy Pacifier - Monkey,I bought this pacifier for my son before he was born. I took it with me to the hospital when I went into labor. The child was attached to it as soon we offered it to him. It's easy to find and you can just throw it in the washer. I ordered him similar ones it but he prefers this on.  He's four and half months now and this is the second one I buy him.,5
Safety 1st Safe-Glow Nursery Monitor 2 Receiver Set,"I put this on my registry not knowing anything about monitors.  My sister had one from another manufacture that had a lot of feed back and a friend of mine had one that you could pick up peoples telephone calls.  I was very nervous with my choice of monitors just because this is our first child and I didn't want anything to be or go wrong.  This monitor is the most perfect monitor out there.  It's crystal clear, you don't pick up anyone elses phone calls, I have never had static other than if the battery is going dead, however that's a good thing because it lets you know that there is a possible problem.. I can walk down the street with this thing and it's still in range.(I just tested it one day when my husband was home, I don't leave my child alone ever.)  It does take 1 9volt battery per reciever, but I replace it every 1-2 months if not longer, and it works perfectly fine when it's plugged in too.  The little light on the bottom tells you when the battery is going low.  It is a powerful monitor it can pick up cars driving by and if it's late at night you can hear dogs barking outside.. If you're awake.  I love this product and have referred it to 3 other people and they are totally pleased with it too.",5

"Boogie Snatcher: Infant, Baby Nose Cleaning Tweezers. Cleans Your Infants Nose For Better Sleep!","Works perfectly!  Some reviews said the tips were too close together and that made me nervous, but I think the width is just right!!  They are small enough for my infants little nose and I feel safe using them on her.  If I need to spread the tips apart when she is older then all I have to do is use my finger to open them up further.  I think the design is made perfectly for little noses.  LOVE LOVE LOVE the boogie snatcher!!!  Buying some for baby shower gifts today...&#34;Boogie Snatcher&#34;.  I know everyone will get a laugh out of that!",5

"Proudbody My Little Prints Baby-Safe Ink Pad, Blue","I took a chance with this product despite negative reviews because it's the cheapest baby pad on Amazon.  It's as others have mentioned, really dry and faint.  I was able to get a pair of light but somewhat acceptable footprints on my baby book.Some tips: 1) add some water to rehydrate the pad, 2) kind of drag your baby's foot on the pad rather than just trying to press it down harder.  Bonus tip: 3) if you mess up the print on your baby book (my daughter stepped her right heel down twice), take a soft white eraser, use it on paper first to make sure it's clean and not smudgy, and you should be able to lighten your mistake.",2
Baby Safe Ink Print Kit - Basic,"I really liked the ink strips...they were easy to use, all you have to do is put your LO's hand or foot on it and your ready to go! I took his hand prints really quickly ... ink...stamp... use the wipe and a quick rinse... done. They turned out great! Plus... easy to order and quick shipping!",5
"Vulli 2 Pack Vanilla Flavored Ring Teethe, Colors May Vary",great smell. baby likes. soft and textured. easy to hold for little ones. scent does fade with numerous washes. good price and alternative to the expensive giraffe,4
"WallStickersUSA Contemporary Wall Sticker Decal, Tree Branches, Leaves, Lovebirds, and Hearts, X-Large","Looks beautiful! Im very happy with this perchase, especially for the price. Is large like it looks in the picture. you are buying what it in that picture not tricks here",5
"Summer Infant Multi-Use Deco Extra Tall Walk-Thru Gate, Bronze","This gate has been the perfect solution for us. It is sturdy and attractive, and it was easy to install. It is also easy to use and it has been holding up to twins who stand up to rattle it like it's their job. We've received a number of compliments on the gate, and I imagine that doesn't happen often. The only potential negative is that the gate opening is relatively narrow and larger people may have more difficulty managing it.",5
"JL Childress Cup 'N Stuff Stroller Pocket, Black","It came in time, works good for my jj cole stroller. Love that it has extra little pockets for my Keyes and money, you can even put your cellphone. I would buy again from this seller.",5
[Award Winning] Kidsme Food Feeder (Large size),"I think this is a great product that is easy to clean up and use.  My son loves it.  He carries it around with him.  However, the LARGE size is very small.  Sometimes it is hard to get food in there!",4
Blooming Bath Baby Bath - Hot Pink,"Got this for my friend when she had her third baby, as a gift, and she raves all about it.  She had a surgery so its difficult for her to lift anything and swoop down to give baths in the bath tub, and this blooming bath was perfect for her situation. Her baby didn't like baths prior to her introducing the blooming bath and now not a peep not a whimper! She loves her blooming baby bath.",5
"Britax Marathon 70-G3 Convertible Car Seat, Onyx",Love this car seat! It feels so safe and secure. Was easy to install and feels very padded and soft for my son.,5
"Munchkin Deluxe Auto Bottle Warmer, Colors May Vary",It worked well for me. :) I used Playtex Ventair and my bottles were fine. I actually have bought one for both of my friends!,5
Stairway Gate Installation Kit (K12) by KidCo,Banister saver.  As a real estate agent I know the importance of keeping your home pristine.  This is great b/c the gate is still secure and safe but saves you from ruining your banister.  unfortunately if you have a wide banister it may not work.,5
MediBuddy - First Aid Kit by me4kidz - Medi Buddy (Assorted Color),"I think its great. People clearly don't read what is in the box. Its not an all out home first aid kit but when I opened it I saw that it is perfect for out and about with my little one and has just the right things a busy mom or dad might need for the minor scrapes and bumps that happen on a regular basis with the little ones. The stickers and fun band-aids are great too! It is appropriate for on the go hurry up and make it better moments. Good size too. My little one picked it up, put it up to her ear and said ""He-wo!""",4
Phil &amp; TedsSport Buggy Travel Bag,We ordered this buggy expecting it to be as pictured royal blue with electric blue.  However we received a stroller that is BLACK with purple inside.  The packaging describes it as Deep Purple.  Just FYI if color matters to you.,1
Moby Wrap Organic Baby Carrier with Matching Knot Hat - Celery,"My daughter in law loves this carrier!Bought it for a daughter in law who is very much into recycling, natural foods, etc. She must have been a hippie in a previous life! She LOVES it and uses it all the time!",4
"Summer Infant SwaddleMe Adjustable Infant Wrap, 3-Pack, Mom &amp; Baby",I have swaddled all three of my kids. The only con to these are that my son outgrew them at 1 1/2 months. He was 11 pounds and was about 23 inches long. He was too long to wear these any more.,4
Fisher-Price Step &amp; Play Piano,"I received this toy as a shower gift and we just love it. My daughter starting using it at 5mths and she just lights up when we put her in it. She loves moving from side to side and turning in every position to see what's going on. She really enjoys stomping her feet to play music. She enjoys playing and reaching for toys although some toys are more challenging then others to reach. All in all, I get to be hands free to cook dinner while she plays in enjoyment.",5
Graco SnugRider Elite Stroller &amp; Car Seat Carrier,"Way better than using the regular stroller. Use it all the time, quick and easy. Light weight and can open one handed.",5
"Joovy Nook Highchair, White Leatherette","The makers of this highchair were trying to make it cool.  In their focus on style they completely overlooked functionality.  The tray is so small that our salad plates do not fit on it.  There is no recline position on the chair. The tray opens and closes with a swing function instead of an on and off latch where the tray comes off completely (which is beneficial when you are trying to clean it in the sink.)  The locking mechanism is VERY difficult to open and close the tray and sometimes when you think it is locked it is not.  I have put my baby in it more than once and thinking it was closed my baby kicked it off and fell out of the high chair. The tray has a rough surface where food gets stuck on the crevices which makes it difficult to clean.  The fact that you can't remove the tray from the chair to wash makes it so much worse.  The chair cover has a lot of crevices and gets dirty very easily.  It is very difficult to remove the cover and the belts.  I have done this a few times and put it in the washing machine and it has come out looking very good but I honestly do not have the energy or the time to do this very often making the chair pretty gross.  Last but not least, there is too much space between the baby and the tray and since the distance is not adjustable all you get is a big, gross, mess and a cranky child who cannot reach their food.  I can safely say I hate this product.",1
Seventh Generation Chlorine Free Baby Wipes Refill 350ct.,"No alcohol, chlorine, fragrance, dyes, or parabens and made w/ food-grade and plant-derived ingredients. Not animal tested and made in the UK. I love these wipes!",5
EvenFlo SmartSteps Exersaucer Entertainer,"I got this exercauser for my son when he was four months old.  He really loved it.  He likes to chew on toys and we have never had a problem with dye running.  He likes to turn the pages, so it's nice that you can turn the volume down on it.  Now that he walks we only use it when we are outside.  I would recomend this to others who are looking for an exercauser.",5
"BOB Revolution SE Single Stroller, Navy",Love it! Folds down really easy. Assembling it takes like 5 minutes. The swivel wheel at the front is definitely worth the extra money. The plum color is really good. Plain old black is kind of boring.,5
"JOTO Premium Screen Protector Film for Samsung Galaxy Gear Watch (Samsung Smartwatch), Ultra Crystal Clear (Invisible) with Lifetime Replacement Warranty (3 Pack)","I like it. It works great so far, I haven't had any problems with it so far. It protects the screen.",4
"Safety 1st Inflatable Spout Guard, Refresh",For under $4 bucks this is a smart buy. Some have said they had mildew issues... Won't have that if you take the time to clean it like anythink else. Loved that the manufacturer actually thought ahead and made it possible for the consumer to size the top hole to fit their shower (just use sharp scissors).,5
The Art of CureTM *SAFETY KNOTTED* Raw chip - Certified Baltic Amber Baby Teething Necklace w/ &quot;The Art of CureTM&quot; Jewelry pouch (SHIPS AND SOLD IN USA),"I bought this necklace for my son before he was born because I used an amber necklace for my daughter and she never had issues.  I have done lots of research on amber and it is very theraputic for teething/pain.  I use this necklace for my 3 month old (already showing signs of teething) and it is very durable, and great looking.  I love the raw and unpolished look.  Great price and quailty.",5
The First Years Microwave Sterilizer,I am not a fan of microwaves but this sterilizer is a great way to use your microwave.  The new mother I got it for loved it and uses it weekly.  Takes away all the hassle of boiling baby bottles to sterilize them. Recommended.,5
"Graco Day 2 Night Sleep System, Ardmore","This was definitely worth the price.  Very sturdy construction and versatile.  The sides of teh play pen curve out as you move up, though.  This is useful for getting the baby out of the bottom while leaning over the sides.  But if you are planning to place it in a tight spot/are limited on space, beware that the dimensions listed are for the base so you'll need an extra ~2inches on each side to fit the top area.My baby girl will love it.",4
The First Years American Red Cross Deluxe Nail Clipper with Magnifier,We started cutting our daughters nails - as opposed to using a nail file - recently.  These do the job great. I don't use the magnifying glass. I go outside where the light is good on our porch.  Cut nails after a bath when they are the softest.,5
"Beco Butterfly II Organic Baby Carrier with Brown Base, Espresso",Very comfortable and easy to use. My little boy loves being in it and falls asleep in it when I'm walking around so that tells me he's comfy.,5
"Goldbug Animal 2 in 1 Harness, Cow",My daughter is 2 and autistic.  She hates wearing anything confining but has little safety awareness. She loves this cow.  It keeps her safe and allows her the freedom to move she desires.  It's also very cute.  I wish the leash was a bit longer and you can't fit much in the backpack but as a safety helper it has made a huge difference for us.,4
"Evenflo Compact Fold High Chair, Polka Dottie Purple",Love this high chair. Really adorable and not to big so it doesn't take up too much space in my apartment. But still very useful it is also easy to put together and easy to clean as well,4
Dr. Brown's Natural Flow Wide Neck Newborn Feeding Set,"I've had good experience with DR Browns bottles in the recent past as I am a first time mom, these are great!",5
"Kinderglo Portable Fun and Safe Rechargeable Night Light, Elephant",I got this for my 3 year old granddaughter. She loves it! I would highly recommend this product to others,5
"green sprouts 10 Pack Waterproof Absorbent Terry Bibs, Girls","After only a few months, threads from the course part of the velcro have poked through the seems, causing minor cuts / scratches to our babies neck.  We thought our daycare provider wasn't matching up the fastener properly and we discussed the minor cuts / scratches with them at length. Perplexed, we looked over the bibs carefully.  These threads are transparent and cannot be seen; only felt and they are sharp!  Of the 10 we have, 7 are like this.  We are incredibly disappointed with the inferior product quality for a line meant for babies.",1
Lambs &amp; Ivy Little Princess Bumper,The bumper is pretty Pricey but makes crib beautiful! The whole set is georgeous. I have purchased all the pieces and the nursery is simply beautiful!!!,4
"Tiny Love Take-Along Arch, Sunny Stroll","My child likes the mobile, but it is unstable on his car seat. He is 8 months old and I have to help hold it on while he plays with it.",4
Prince Lionheart Jumbo Toy Hammock,This product is made from a very good material and is very sturdy. i would have maybe liked to choose the color but other than that very good product,5
"Nuby Paci Cradle Pacifier Box, Colors may vary","It's a good case to hold a pacifier. However, it says that it holds 2. Considering the size of most pacifiers, it really only holds 1 unless you have small ones and really squish them in. I also wish that you could pick the color....I am now carrying around a purple pacifier holder with my son's green diaper bag.Other than it only holding one and not being able to pick the color, this is a good product. It does what it is supposed to. It never opens up in the diaper bag, the hook works great, and it's easy to clean. I would probably buy again if I ever needed another one.",3
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"I don't know if the baby likes this toy.But it looks very cute and sweet, nice colors... I love it.",5
Summer Infant Contoured Changing Pad Amazon Frustration Free Packaging,"We bought this for my grand children so that it would be comfortable for them as well as for us, when we would be changing diapers. It is important that they don't roll off, so the contour is quite good in that regard.",5
Summer Infant Best View Handheld Color Video Monitor with 2.5&quot; Screen,"This is our second video monitor for our baby daughter.  The first one was fine, but it had reception issues at times and the audio was frequently scratchy.  This one, on the other hand, is amazing.  It's all digital and both the audio and video are fantastic.  I read on another site where some people had an issue with interference since it operates on 2.4 GHz.  Well, our 2.4GHz D-Link MiMo router is directly between our baby's room and the monitor and we have no problems at all.Now for the best part (well, the reception is the best part, so I guess this is the coolest part), you have full control over pan and tilt from the remote.  With this, we can watch our daughter anywhere she is in the room.  And the mechanism is so quiet, our baby doesn't hear it at all.Finally, we got ours at Target for $169 on sale.  Target says the list is $199 which is much less than what Amazon lists it for, but my guess is you'll see it come down on price soon.Bottom line, this is a fantastic video and audio monitor.  The only feature it doesn't have is the motion sensor which we had on a non-video monitor we used when our daughter was born, but other than that, this one is a winner!",5
"Munchkin Deluxe Dishwasher Basket, Colors May Vary","I'd recommend this to anyone with a dishwasher. Small items get washed at our baby-free house all the time- lids to water bottles, parts for equipment like Camel packs, plastic teaspoon measures that I'd prefer on the top rack, household decor items, parts for the pet fountain, etc. This holds it all. Even items that are small enough to fit through the holes don't do so, they stay in place. I don't know why dishwashers don't come with these!",5
Kidkusion Toddler Corner Kushions Off White - 4 Pack,"These bumpers are exactly as I expected - except they came with 12 pieces of tape, not 16. I mean, it could just be me, but my 9 month old will stick his pointy little fingers under anything and rip it off in seconds, so it made sense to me to put a piece of tape on each face of the corner when I stuck it on. (Both legs of the top, and both legs of the side.) But I guess I had to pick - did I want to do 3 faces of all four corners? Or did I only want to do 3 corners? This is an annoying way for the company to ""cut corners"" and save a dime.",3
"Badger Basket Diaper Corner Changing Table, Natural","I asked for this table at my shower. I selected it because it is a real space saver and that it had plenty of room for storage. It seemed to make sense to have the baby butt facing me. As a first time mom I wasn't sure what to expect. This table is a dream. I couldn't imagine changing my baby any other way. Not only do I have a good view of his bottom, but we get to have one on one time face to face. My baby is 4 months old now, and everyday I use this table I love it even more. The table it have some minor factory imperfections but for the price I had no issues with them. I strongly recommend this for first time moms.",5
"Nuby 10 Pack Hangers, Colors May Vary","Ergonomic design and smooth edges. Very good quality and price. Only downside is not being able to choose colors. However, they are all pastels or white, which we like for our kids.",5
"Disney Premier Pounce and Play, The Lion King",My son got this as a christmas gift and started using it around 5 months. He absolutely loves it. And I love that it matches all of his stuff.,5
Zippy Fun Bandana Bibs for Babies and Toddlers (Fun Characters for Boys) (Pack of 4),"1st, these are great bibs for our infant to drool all over.  They look great and soak up a ton of drool.That being said, good luck getting the ones you want.  This is the third time I've ordered the ""Fun Characters for Boys"" set.  The 1st time (back when it had the ink splotch, alien/robot, dinosaur and one other) it came in as anticipated with no problems.I ordered a second set of the ""Fun Characters for Boys"" since I liked them the most.  I received a polk-a-dot and stars set I think named ""Stylish for Boys.""  We ended up keeping them since they weren't bad and my wife thought they would be good for the 4th of July.They changed what was in the pack of ""Fun Characters for Boys"" to the ink splotch, pirate, dog and caterpillar.  I ordered the set again.  I again received the same ""Stylish for Boys"" set.  This time I'm sending it back and I'm not sure if I should try again or not.I assume the problem is that the bag they come in is labeled ""Zippy Fun Bandana Bibs ...s for Boys) (Pack of 4).  The truncated bag label means all of the boys packs have the same label, I don't know if the barcode is different or not, or if they scan it or just grab it.UPDATE 6-5-14: Yep third time ordering these and the third time they sent the wrong ones...I see that the item has been marked ""Unavailable - Item Under Review"" so hopefully they will solve the problem.  I'll return them and try again once they are available.",5
Philips AVENT Digital Video Baby Monitor,"we dropped both parts numerous times, and it still works fine. no pan/tilt/zoom, and you will not be able to mount the camera part, but otherwise does what it claims.  I like the feature that wakes it up when there is noise near the camera.  Would be nice if the volume could be turned higher, as I can often sleep right through the baby crying.  Luckily my wife wakes up to it.  I think there are probably all-around options out there, but we were happy with this, and it does the trick.  Would also have been nice to be able to add additional cameras/viewers, i.e. if it worked as a system.  Also, no wifi or internet capability, so buyers must know the limitations.  I suggest researching other options before picking any one of these monitors.  Consumer Reports has a good breakdown.",4
Svan Svan High Chair Cushion - Sage,"We've loved this high-chair for our daughter, and are now getting a second for our baby boy.  Works great as both a high-chair and a ""high chair"" for big kids.  And looks beautiful -- tons of compliments.  Easy to assemble and clean.",5
Kate Aspen &quot;About To Hatch&quot; Stainless-Steel Egg Whisk in Showcase Gift Box,These are very cute. I bought several to use as prizes for a baby shower I'm having for my niece. They are quite small though so probably impractical for kitchen use.,4
"Safety 1st Crystal Clear Baby Monitor, White","I bought this product to replace the same exact item that my three year old broke. (no fault of the product) I live in a small apartment, and have never had any issues with static or interference.  The only thing I wasn't thrilled about is that the price of this product had nearly doubled since the first time I bought it. (about 7 months earlier)",4
Montalban Trailer 3 with Jogger Conversion - Folds Flat for Storage,Just bought the 4 today and didn't even get to test drive it. It states PSI min 40 and max 65. I filled the tires to 45 and went to test drive. The tire exploded on me. Horrible and I still hear ringing in my ears. Not sure how my 1 year old feels but it was horrible. I was so excited to use it. That alone makes me want to return it.,1
"Megaseat Infant Floor Seat with Safety Belt, Ruby Red","I purchased this seat for my 9 month. He likes it. Because he is not a chubby baby, I think I can use it till he is one year old.",5
"Graco Lauren Classic Crib, Espresso","I just moved and my crib broke during the move! We needed a new one asap. Our old one was a drop side and I didn't think it was necessary. I was looking for something affordable, simple, attractive, sturdy and safe so I decided to buy this one. I put it together by myself and it was pretty simple. It is sturdy and the rails are closer together than my old crib, I like that. I also like that it will convert into a toddler bed when we reach that stage.Our crib came in perfect condition. I see that someone put up multiple photos of the crib damaged from shipping. In my opinion this is an unfair review of the product because it is not reviewing the crib, but the method and treatment of the crib during shipping. I too have received badly damaged items when I've ordered online, but that is not a reflection of the product, it is a reflection of the shipping carrier/method.",5
GroVia BioLiners One Size Unscented - 200 Count,"Grovia bioliners do the job they're intended to do. I like the size of these bioliners. I've read other reviews elsewhere that complained about how large these liners are. Based on my experience of using 200 of these, I can't imagine having them any smaller. For us, they have done a good job of collecting poop. We rarely have poop that makes its way onto the diaper. We lay them flat in an open diaper, fasten the diaper, and tuck the small bit of excess bioliner into the leg gussets. These liners, compared to others, are also a good bang for the buck. I have not tried other brands of bioliners, but have been satisfied with these and have no complaints. I plan on sticking with Grovia bioliners because they do their job and are a good price.",5
Philips AVENT Straw Cups 9oz 12m+ - Pink,"It easy to clean, never leak even put in bag. My baby likes to drink with this bottle; I always fill water or milk in it.",5
"phil&amp;teds Portable Traveller Crib, Black","My husband and I hesitated to buy this because of the price but I am so glad we did! We recently took it to Europe for our 1 1/2 year old. It was compact and lightweight enough that I could strap it into the tent straps on my backpack, which meant my hands were free to carry a screaming toddler through the airport. One of the sides unzips so kids can get in and out at their leisure, which my son loved. The mattress seems comfortable even though it is thin. We put a blanket underneath the crib for extra padding but probably didn't need to. I can't imagine going back to our old Pack n' Play after this.One set of poles was was a little difficult to disassemble on our crib. It was a two person job. Maybe one of our poles is a little bent or something. Anyway, the pros of this crib far outweigh that small con.",5
VTech Communications Safe &amp; Sound Digital Audio Monitor with two Parent Units,We have had these for 2 months now and have been impressed with sound quality and the range of the units. I will update after a few months,5
"Tiny Love Take-Along Arch, Sunny Stroll","We bought this for our 2month old who screams uncontrallably in the car seat/car (our daughter was the same way) partly due to boredome, inability to sooth himself, and acid reflux pain.  We were hoping it would be a distraction.  It is interesting to look at but he liks to look more up or straight ahead and the way it attaches to his seat he has to look down a bit.  We had to flip up the car seat padding to attach it and it still isn't very secure.  For instance if he were able to pull the string on the spinning toy it would probably come detached form his carseat as it will if you hit it too hard when putting him in.  Also the string is too hard to pull I think for the average baby of any age.  A plus is that it can pivot forward and back while attached so you can pivot it forward all the way to put your baby in their seat and then back up to where it's comfortable for them.  It's worth buying if you're desparate for a car toy but it definitely could use some tweaking in the design and will probably be liked more by an older baby (there's no black and white on it and is almost too busy for a newborn).",3
Fisher-Price Rainforest Melodies and Lights Deluxe Gym,Our little muffin didn't enjoy it at 6 weeks but he is now 8 and loves it.  We recommend it for infants. We use it for tummy time as well.,5
Peg Perego Aria Twin Double Stroller in Toffee,"SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! Do not buy this!!!! I hope you listen because you will be very very very sorry.  I was attracted to it because it is sleek and cooler looking that the bulky frumpy Gracos, but once it arrived I was sorry I bought it. The cupholder broke the first week and is long gone. The fold up and stand option never works.  It falls over everytime.  However, the worst and most annoying part about this thing is that the stroller has absolutely NO manuverability. The wheels constantly get stuck. The plastic is so flimpsy and they used such cheapo materials.  Peg Perego should be ashamed they are charging so much for such a junky stroller.  I am tossing it and buying a different one.",1
"OXO Tot Training Cup, Aqua, 7 Ounce","Our daughter has used this cup since she was 11 months old. If you are looking for a spill-proof cup, this one is not for you. But it is a great way to get your child used to drinking out of a cup. The lid insert makes it so that all of the water doesn't pour out as fast- great for little ones learning to drink from a cup.",5
"Graco LiteRider Classic Connect Stroller, Pasadena","This is a great, convenient, light and easy to take places stroller !!! For the mothers that like to travel this is a life saver! It's not as small as umbrella stroller and not as heavy as a regular stroller. It's comftirble for the baby and easy for moms! I defiantly would recommend this product for mothers that like to travel and I give it 5 stars!!!",5
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"I have one year old twins (a boy and a girl) and they are very active.  This has been a lifesaver.  We call it their ""corral"".  If I need to get a shower or cook or do anything that I can't keep a constant watch over the twins, I put them in the ""corral"".  We take it with us camping, to the beach, to Meme and Granddaddy's house and to family reunions.  We bought the extension set also so it would be big enough for two.  I can't rave about it enough.  We attach fun toys to the sides of it and the babies really like it.  In case you are wondering about older kids, it contains my very active two year old neice when she visits as well. This is something I couldn't live without.",5
Summer Infant Deluxe PiddlePad,"I read all kinds of reviews for this product and I was wondering if I should get it or not and I did buy it. I am glad I did cause it sure does work for us. My boys were 19 months when we got it and they were already out of diapers. I got few for the car and few for the stroller I ended up returning some and kept 4 total one for each car seat and two fro the twin stroller. The reason why we did not keep them all is cause we realized they r so good, dry so fast and do the job the way they should we never had to replace it. However if you plann to travel long way and do not want to take the one from the stroller its good to have two sets in the car just in case. I am so happy with the product and the price was great.",5

"Dreambaby Extra Tall Swing Close Gate with Extensions, White","This gate gets heavy duty use at our house and it works great. We use it to keep our dogs away from the bedrooms, so it has been used in a heavily-used hallway for almost a year now. Seriously, we must open and close it 100 times a day. The self-closing hinge/latch has stopped working so we do have to pull the gate shut behind us now, but considering how much run in and out I'm not surprised. It is pretty sturdy and looks fine. The only things we've had to do is tighten the extensions a couple times. We're happy with it.",4
Medela Supplemental Nursing System,"I recently had my first child and was dedicated to breastfeeding. Unfortunately, due to a breast reduction surgery I had in the past my milk supply has been low. I do make almost enough milk and found the idea of giving up breastfeeding all together devestating. The nipple confusion that can come with giving a bottle is very real, not to mention how upset my daughter got when I would have to stop in the middle of feeding her to go make up the bottle. With this, I can fix the supplement in the beginning, feed it to her while breastfeeding, and we are both happy and comfortable...and she is getting the nutrition she needs with the bonding of breastfeeding.This product has been a lifesaver for me.",5
"Co-Rider Child Bike Seat, Black","I really like how my 3 year has his own handle bars and balances upright, so he can be more active on our rides, instead of just being a passenger. It is not appropriate for our 1 2/2 year old, because she gets sleepy and tired after a little while on the bike and can't hold herself upright the whole time. We bought a yepp front mount for her.The co-rider bolts onto the bike frame and doesn't go on and off easily, so that will be a space factor if you are using a bike rack. We have a 3 bicycle rack, so we can fit both of our bikes on, with the co-rider if we leave the middle bike space empty.",4
"Cosco - Gentle Motion Swing, Jungle Harmony",My son love it. He sleep and play all the time on this swing. Highly recommend to everyone!!!!!!,5
"Kushies 2 Pack No Scratch Mittens, White","There is no elastic in them, they were great for one use only... once you  wash it, they look cheap, and hard to put on baby's hand.. overall, i do not suggest buying this item if you count on multiple uses!!! disappointed ...",1

Medela SoftShells Breast Shells For Sore Nipples,"This is a great product to wear in your bra during the day when it's not possible to wear the Avent Nipplette. I've gotten the best results from combining the use of these two products at different times of the day. I have had impressive results in a short amount of time. I will have to wear the SoftShells exclusively in my third trimester (since you can't wear the Nipplette during that time), and I am confident the SoftShells will maintain the gains I've made during my 2nd trimester. I'm very happy with the progress seen from the consistent use of this product.",5
"Philips AVENT Disposable Nursing Pads,  100-Count","I had used these pads with my first son 3 years ago.  I had no problem with them with him, so bought it again with my second child.They have changed the design from a few years ago.  The one thing I do not like is the excess trim around the pad. If I don't bend it outwards, the pads tend to be itchy and uncomfortable.Thus far, they haven't leaked.",3
Lamaze Musical Inchworm,my gradson loves this he is 5 monthes old and I put it so he can kick it and loves the crinkle sound it makes when kicked.  love the bright colors.  I have  some other Lamaze toys and have liked all of them.,5
Turquoise and Gray Chevron Zig Zag Musical Baby Crib Mobile by Sweet Jojo Designs,"It matches the set and looks great, goes together in minutes but overall, it has a &#34;cheap&#34; look and feel to it. it plays music ... but it's creepy and I won't be using that I'm guessing.",4
"Philips AVENT Soothie Pacifier, 0-3 Months, 2-Pack, Pink/Purple",I found that my newborn liked this style of pacifier for the first three weeks but afterwards he won't take them.,3
"Britax Regent Youth Car Seat, Onyx","I wasnt ready to put my 3yr old in a booster seat, but he was almost to outgrow the 40lb weight limit on his other carseat.  The Regent is perfect for him!  It was easy to install, and fits in our minivan great!  And this seat will fit him for years to come.  I'd definitely recommend this seat to a friend.",5
"NoJo Plum Dandy Lamp and Shade, Plum/Prpl","This is really cute.  Honestly, I got it for my purple room.  (I guess I'm a kid at heart!)  I won't be able to read in bed with a 40 Watt light bulb.",4
"Kushies Nursing Canopy, Cream Polka Dots","I tried several styles of nursing drapes and this was by far the best. It's not too big and covers well. The neck hole is adjustable and was large enough to allow me to see the baby nursing by not so large as to expose myself. It covered enough so that I could switch sides without exposure. Many times people never noticed that I was nursing. The only thing that gave it away was the fabric which is not a pattern most would wear as a shirt. About the fabric-heavy enough to cover but not too thick as to be too hot to wear or overheat the baby (I had a July baby and used this without getting either one of us terribly sweaty) I had two of these that I alternated when washing and the fabric is very durable. Both are still in great condition after 2 children. I highly recommend this!Pros-Great coverage, best size for its function, launders well.  Cons-wish they had more fabric patterns to chose from",5
Tiny Love Touch and Discover Electronic Play Book in Blue/Yellow,"This is a cute book.  My 12 month old daughter likes listening to the animal sounds.  I only wish it was longer or had more substance to it.  It has the cow on the front, and then a page each for a duck, a frog, a sheep, a chicken, birds, and the sun (which plays a short tune).  Although in the future she should be able to figure out how to use the book by herself, in general I think this book best for younger infants.",4
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,"My foster baby went through many kids of bottles as he was very anti-eating. I bought these thinking he wouldn't have to stop to let air in once he finally would get started. He got NOTHING! I even grabbed another bottle, filled it with water and tried. I couldn't get ANYTHING! I know someone who use them and she said you have to be careful because many of them don't work~ she had to keep taking them back and exchanging them until she got a few that did work. Well that is more than I care to do. One of my 6 worked properly and once I put it through the dishwasher it was no good. I threw them all in the trash because I didn't want any other baby to have to scream and cry out of frustration by being teased by a bottle.",1
"Carters Super Soft Dot Changing Pad Cover, Chocolate",These are so wonderfully soft and easy to put on and take off because lord knows you will wash it elevnty billion times before its all said and done.  We liked it so much we bought the same one when we bought another diaper change station.,5
"OXO Tot Tub Drain Stopper, Blue","I have forever messed with the nasty white stoppers with the little metal ring on the top, you all have one...go look in your grandma's tub. Now think how could this be improved? This guy rocks cause of the larger surface area and just enough weight from the metal disc in the middle you can slap this over pretty much any drain and it will form a great seal that isn't shifted around by the tub water blasting down on it (unlike those lame white plugs). My two year old loves messing with it and has no issues grabbing it by the handy tab, those with dexterous toes can also no-hand grab it as well if needed.",5
"Stork Craft Tuscany 4 in 1 Fixed Side Convertible Crib, White",This is a great product for the money it seems to be very sturdyand the ergonomic features makes it very good because it changes as your child grows.,5
"Motorola MBP33 Wireless Video Baby Monitor with Infrared Night Vision and Zoom, 2.8 Inch",This monitor is terrible! After about 6 months it started to make this high pitched noise. Then the power cord broke and we bought a replacement online which we hardly works (this also happened to my sister who has the same one). The most recent issues is no sound! So angry we bought this one and cannot believe the other reviews online which has made be question the validity of the reviews!,1
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"My little guy loves his star teether! It's great entertainment for him, and he likes the opposite spinning side too. It was easy to introduce to him, and easy to clean too!",5
Baby Einstein Baby Neptune Carrier Toy Bar,We loved this item when our daughter was in her infant carrier.  She loves any Einstein and this item was no different.  She would sit there and bat at the fish and watch Neptune bob around.  She also loved the music.  The only problem was that it was way too loud for an infant!  My husband but 25 layers of masking tape across the speaker to get it to a level that wasn't deafing.  It also got a little annoying when it would play the some songs over and over.  So it's good item that just needs a bit of improving.,3
Medela Swing Breastpump,"This pump works great. I bought it so we can have babysitters feed our daughter a bottle if we are gone for an extended period of time. It works MUCH better than the hand pump that I had that took FOREVER! The swing pump took a couple times to get down, but it works great. Medela is the brand to go with when it comes to pumping.",5
Snoogle Chic Total Body Pillow,This body pillow flattened very quickly.  It took up too much room in the bed.  I found it was much more comfortable to use a few king size pillows to create the comfort I needed.  Save your money and use your own pillows!,2
Diaper Dude Chicago Cubs Diaper Bag,"I bought this as mine and my husbands diaper bag.  I wanted to get something that he would be ok with carrying around... but as it turned out he rarely carried it since we mostly went places while he was working.  I thought that it did the job, but I still had trouble getting everything to fit and stay organized there.  It would have been nice if there were more pockets and compartments on the inside, otherwise everything was just dumped into the same area.  Since I realized that it was mine, instead of ours, I ended up going with a more stylish Coach diaper bag that could later serve as a giant purse.  If we ever have another baby the Diaper Dude will be a spare bag that will stay in my husbands car.",4
Graco Pack 'N Play Playard with Bassinet in Rise and Shine,"Easy to assemble, durable, and our toddler absolutely loves this.  I like the add on to make it a bassinet as well.",5

"Turtlemeter, the Baby Bath Floating Turtle Toy and Bath Tub Thermometer","After reading all the great reviews, I decided to go ahead and buy this temp turtle. Boy, do I not regret it!! I love that it reads the temperature every second and that my baby is nice and warm in the tub. Not to cold, not to hot. As a new mom I'm constantly worried, so thx to the bath turtle it's one less thing I have to be worried about!! Thank you to the makers for making such an awesome product. Keep up the good work!!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We opted to register for this diaper pail because it didn't require costly refills.  It seemed to work well at first, although the changing of bags was a bit of a pain.  By the time my son was 8 months old, the pail began to stink a lot.  We always wiped it down and sprayed it with Lysol.  Eventually, a piece of foam from inside (I'm guessing this helped to keep the smells inside) came loose.  We finally had to throw it out when my son was 9 1/2 months old. My neighber who had a baby at the same time also owned the Champ and had to toss her's out when her daughter was 5 months old.  The same thing happened to her.We are now expecting our second child and are in the process of buying a new pail - probably the Neat System.",3
"Under The Nile Organic Baby Buddy, Veggie Print",I have a 6 month old son whom I bought this for and he loves it!  He is teething and loves to suck on the knot in the hat and the feet. It is a great size for his little hands and convenient fit for the diaper bag. I would recommend this little guy to anyone- great addition to any gift.,5
"Newco International Kids Sprinkles Bean Bag Chair, Green",Beans bags are costly....not sure why but they also run small....hard to gage size from pictures. Kids love them though!,3
"Motorola MBP36 Remote Wireless Video Baby Monitor with 3.5-Inch Color LCD Screen, Infrared Night Vision and Remote Camera Pan, Tilt, and Zoom","We tried a lot of baby monitors and was super impressed with this model. Worked great for 8 months, then stopped working. Called warranty support on sep 19 th and emailed them a copy of the invoice moments later. It is now October and no replacement device. Called warranty support and they claim they never received the email, even though I have a confirmation from them.Long story short this baby monitor is not worth the money. Once it breaks you will be without a monitor for a long time.Check the reviews, this monitor is not holding up well.update, November 3rd. I have been sent 2 replacement refurbished monitors, neither would turn on. Waiting on a third replacement with no idea when it will arrive. Terrible customer support.",1
Munchkin 3 Count Stay Put Suction Bowl,ordered 2 packages. in both of them the medium size bowl does not seal as it should.atached well to surfaces.,3
"Kiddopotamus Poch&eacute; Pacifier Pouch, Khaki","This doesn't work very well for me.  It's made of such thick stiff material and the opening is kind of small so that it's hard to get the pacifiers in and out and you can only fit about 2 before it's hard to close.  When I try to fit in 3 (for my 5 month old and 3 year old) the clasp won't stay shut.  There's got to be a better option.  It's pretty cute though, although when I put it on the diaper bag my husband gets upset because it looks so girly.  Overall I wouldn't buy it again.",2
"Skip Hop Zoo Safety Harness, Monkey","My two and a half year old, six month old, and I all flew out to Utah from Wisconsin, with a two hour layover in Colorado. My son already had the Skip Hop Zoo Monkey suitcase (which we love!!!). So when I saw this at Toys R Us for $15 (and noticed all the 5star reviews on amazon), I decided it would be worth it (I had a gift card for that amount). My son didn't love it at first (he did LOVE this suitcase right away). But after some adjusting he got use to the chest snap being right up on his neck. I have to say, he looked super cute wearing it and hauling around his matching suitcase.But ... I only held on to the harness for about 45 seconds. It made me feel like I was going to walk right over the top of him. If I were traveling in Asia (lived in Singapore for a few years), this would be perfect! But all three of the airports we were traveling through were open enough my little guy could walk a few inches ahead or behind me without getting lost. He isn't the kind of kid who just takes off.So in the end, pushing around his suitcase did more to keep him by my side than this harness did. I'm not sure we'll ever use it for more than a backpack to carry around snacks in. It worked great for that!",3
"Simple Wishes Hands-Free Breastpump Bra, Pink, XS-L","Prior to purchasing this &#34;bra&#34; I hated pumping. I have a handheld pump and I was completely useless when pumping without this &#34;bra&#34;. I am now able to eat a meal, pick up my child when she cries, use the computer, etc. all while pumping. Yes, I cannot bend over too far without spilling some milk , so I am still unable to perform certain tasks (make the bed or unload the dishwasher), but honestly, this is the most wonderful purchase I have ever made. I have been able to keep my sanity over the past month due to this purchase. I highly recommend.",5
"Neat Solutions Sesame Street Table Topper Disposable Stick-in-Place Placemats, 50-Count","I purchased these table toppers for eating out with my 5.5 year old, 2 year old, and 7 month old...My toddler and baby would constantly lick the table, or chew on it or something, and they both eat OFF a table, so I was quite concerned... I am NOT a ""germaphobe"", and I rarely wipe down a restaurant highchair unless its filthy, but the table and food is what I think is discusting (would you eat off a restaurant table?)The table topper sticks to the table by two adhesive edges, on the top and bottom. I called the company to ask why its not all the way around (closer to the edges) and they said that would be too costly, and parents would have a difficult time removing the toppers themselves... I still think the prouduct would be GREATLY improved if the WHOLE topper was adhesive, like you tore back a sheet of wax paper and the topper was a big ""sticker"", but there would be a little tab on one corner to help you remove it. Anyway, when your child is done you simply pick up the topper (with the contents), roll it, and dump it!Well for babies, this is a VERY fantastic invention... Well, if you have a baby that touches everything, and is VERY curious, it may not work... My son is too interested in his cup, or his toy to be thinking about the table topper, so it works. He loves to pat his hands on it though, and he also enjoys ""eating"" the topper...My toddler will occasionally ""go for the topper"", but if she becomes bored, she will rip the thing off in seconds... I am trying to get her to actually eat off a plastic plate (we tote around) but she still tips it over and such... She's a HUGE Elmo fanatic though, so my reward for her keeping it on, is getting to see Elmo... but yet she STILL removes the thing! I feel like toting around my OWN double sided tape to attatch to the thing, but thats sort of out there...So I guess it really depends on your child, but I would recomend to atleast try the product, because when your child leaves it alone, its truly a fantastic solution! It also fits well in diaper bags or purses.",4
"Thirsties Duo All in One Snap, Blackbird, Size One (6-18 lbs)","Cute diaper that works very well.  Enjoy the all in one, but takes longer to dry than a pocket diaper.",4
Samsung Ezview Baby Monitor,"We were given this monitor initially as a baby shower gift and unfortunately had to purchase another one because my 14 month old son thought the monitor should take a swim in our dog's water bowl. We tried another monitor in the interim and were disappointed because the screen would time out after 5 minutes and you couldn't adjust the sensitivity on the that brand's monitor. We have a fan running in our room for noise to sleep and you would constantly hear the fan noise through the monitor. So we went ahead and purchased this monitor because we liked it so much. The only thing that would give this monitor a 5 star rating is if it had zoom capability. Now we have the monitor plus 2 cameras so set up to monitor different angles of our son. Good purchase, you can't go wrong with this monitor.",4
"Playtex TrainingTime Soft Spout Cup, 6 Ounce, 2 Pack, Color May Vary","I bought these because they are guaranteed not to leak.  But of course they leak.  They're junk.  Not worth the effort to return them, but disappointing.",1
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt",Be very careful using this play pen. My baby loves playing without shoes or socks on. He was plaing in the play pen wiggling his legs against the walls of the play pen. Apparently the walls in the play pen are made from a very rough netting and scrubbed the skin off my babies toes. At first I couldn't understand why he had blood on his toes but then we noticed blood lines on the white netting. From now on he is only allowed to play inside when his shoes are on.,1
"RECARO ProSPORT Combination Harness To Booster Car Seat, Blue Opal",I am sooo happy I bought this car seat! The baby loves it too! He actually can see out the window. He loves seeing the ocean when we pass it,5
"Baby Cache Serenity Guardrail, Espresso","When I received this item, I waited a couple of months to open it. I didn't have the crib yet so I didn't want to open the guardrail yet. I trusted that everything would be fine. When I finally opened it, it was damaged and cracked. It also had water stains. I'm very disappointed. I take responsibility for not checking sooner. I'm not sure what to do with this now.",2
Recaro Signo Convertible Car Seat Midnight Desert,"We got this seat for our now 2-year-old a few months ago as a second seat for my wife's car. We had had a Britax Boulevard CS for him for the previous 9 months or so, and I had thought that was a great seat. I was initially drawn to this seat because of my interest and involvement in motorsports and Recaro's history there, but this seat is better than the Boulevard in pretty much every way.The feel of the latches and tightening mechanism just feel very smooth and well-constructed, and the materials are very soft and very well-padded. Because he is basically wrapped in padding on three sides, he tends to get a little sweaty when it's warm out, but I guess that's the price you pay for safety. The pads on the shoulder straps are much longer than the ones on the Britax, which is nice because there are times when the pads on the Britax shift a little when tightening, and his neck will get pinched between the strap and the pad.The only negative I've found with this seat is that the straps tend to twist sometimes, but that may be more a product of my wife's tendency to pull the straps out way more than necessary when taking our son out of the seat.Given the quality of the seat and the price we found on Amazon, I would not hesitate to buy one more of these for each of our cars for our daughter once she's out of her infant seat.",4
Baby Doll Waffle Pique Baby Moses Basket Color: Ecru,"With my first baby, I had a rigid Badger Basket Moses basket that fit into a basinette stand. It was beautiful and sturdy, but so, so heavy and weighed more at one end than the other due to the canopy over the baby's head, making it impossible to carry the baby around in from upstairs to down. This basket is completely the opposite!PRO'S:Lightweight. There is no plastic or metal in the weave for shape, so the woven material is the entirety of the weight and yet still retains its beautiful shape. The mattress is thin but the plush padding makes it incredibly soft and cozy.Large. Just for a laugh, I put my 2 year old in this basket and he fit perfectly from head to toes - it's much bigger than you would expect yet like I said, isn't too heavy and bulky. Also it's much more long than wide, making it perfect to snuggle in for a little newborn.Pretty! The bows are removable velcro, but they are so cute I'd never take them off. The bumper and padding are gently textured to look so elegant in the off-white color, and the sturdy weave of the basket is attractive.CONS: The basinette stand by Jolly Jumper is sold separately - a package deal would've been nice.",5
"Petunia Pickle Bottom Abundance Boxy Backpack Diaper Bag, Frolicking in Fez","This bag is so gorgeous, not only will i be using it as a diaper bag for my 2 little ones, but it will be my overnight, weekender bag once they're grown. It is so functional with its many pockets, and removable diaper changer. I've read reviews that it is too big, but i don't think so at all. It may even be a tad too small, once you get the kids' extra clothes and necessities in it. I absolutely love this bag!!! So worth it!!!!",5
DEX Products Grab N Go Bottle Warmer BWC-01,"I love this warmer.  I bought this when looking for a way to warm bottles while traveling and fell in love with it after the first use.  I have used it over and over again and have boiled it over and over again and it still works perfectly.  I use the nurser bottles and just use the two tops you would use if you were freezing the milk.  Then pop it in the warmer without the outer plastic covering to get warm.  When warm, place back in plastic outer shell and you are ready to go.  Besides, it is just cool, however it works.  Many times I've clicked it for no other reason than to just show it off.  I highly recommend this product!!",5

I would recommend this product to anyone who needs a replacement and isn't willing to pay an arm and a leg for it.,5
"Westwood Design Copa Convertible Crib, Cider","A great crib for the price. All of the bolts are covered and out of baby's reach. My only quibble is the placement of bolts to attache the front of the crib. None of those bolts are easy to install.  It is not impossible, but it does slow down assembly considerably.",4

WEXY Lunch and Munch Snack Bags for Kids Lunch Boxes Fun (3pack),"We go through boxes of regular size sandwich bags like crazy around our house. They have more uses than just for food, but their main job is keeping food for on the go. Like most households they are a staple. Recently, I was given a box of WEXY Bags to try out with our family and to say they were a hit is an understatement!If you haven't already tried these cute and colorful sealable bags that carry snacks and are very attractive to kids you should. Take a look at their 4 funky characters and you'll instantly see why they are popular. Each character has a unique name and story. For example Sammy the Surfer is gluten and dairy free.  This allows children who may have food allergies connect with a special little monster who makes snack time fun.According to the Food Allergy Research and Education 1 in every 13 children has some type of food allergy. With the number of children with food allergies growing, the awareness and sensitivity to those affected is being addressed by people like WEXY Bags.The bags are BPA and biodegradable and were created by 2 moms who wanted their children to enjoy healthy foods in fun plus sized packages. Two mothers wanted to take part in raising awareness and making a fun product that everyone can enjoy and they have succeeded! My kids have enjoyed the characters and I've found them to be a special way to add something special to their lunch sack.[...]",5
Summer Infant Sure Sight Digital Color Video Monitor,"It's great to find a device like this that truly &#34;just works&#34; from the time you take it out of the package. It's also well-adorned with &#34;dedicated&#34; buttons and switches for functions such as volume up and down. I.e., there are no menus to hunt through. (Menus vs. physical buttons are a way for manufacturers to save money.) The entire construction of both units is sturdy and reassuring as well. On the downside, the screen is a little smaller than what we're used to these days with typical phones and iPods, but as a baby monitoring device, it's definitely large enough.",4
Ocean Wonders Musical Aquarium Crib Attachment,I bought this aquarium for my baby girl since her brother loved the original.This was a terrible re-design.  It continually falls apart.  My husband even used zip ties and duct tape to keep the battery pack connected to the main body.Don't waste your money.,1

DaVinci Elizabeth II Convertible Toddler Bed in White,"We purchased the bed for my son 3 years ago and never had any problems with the bed. The maple color looks very beautiful. I really like the full-length railing, which keeps my boy from falling out. He is almost 5 years old and very soon he will outgrow it. But for now, he is still very happy with his bed.",5
"Leachco Safer Bather Infant Bath Pad, Blue Fish","Why put your newborn in a hard plastic seat, when you can have him/her lie on a virtual pillow? My kitchen sink is one of those not evenly split; it has a tiny section on one side and extra wide on the other and this bather fits perfectly into it. My baby has never cried (not even the first time)in this. Why should he? He's covered in warm water, has his head propped up just right, and is on a soft pillow. The really great thing about this bather is that it becomes heavy when wet, so it won't slide around. But when you squeeze some of the water out, it instantly becomes light again.  Simply brilliant! Don't even consider any of the others - this one is perfect!!!",5

Exergen Temporal Artery Thermometer MODEL# TAT-2000C,Wish I would have purchased this item long ago. Easy to use and very accurate.

"American Baby Company Heavenly Soft Chenille Fitted Contoured Changing Pad Cover,Ecru",Love how soft this changing pad cover is. It fits our Summer Infant pad perfectly - and has two small slit cutouts for the security straps should you choose to use them. We will also be using changing pad covers to protect the material - but this looks so nice and is so soft!,5

"North American Bear Sleepyhead Cozy, Bunny Pink","I was given just one of these for my daughter as a gift. She was soon in love with her bunny, so had to buy three more in case they got lost or needed a wash. I often find her sucking it to go to sleep as she doesn't have a dummy. It washed really well and remains nice and soft.",5
"aden + anais Muslin Dream Blanket, For The Birds - Owl","I bought this planning to have my toddler use it as a warmer (but still breathable) blanket in during the cooler winter months, which are still fairly mild in SoCal where we live.  She still sleeps in toddler-sized sleep-sacks at night, but needed a blanket for daytime naps.  Unfortunately, this Dream Blanket was a bit too heavy for my daughter to sleep comfortably in it, since she was used to the lighter, summer-weight muslin blankets.  However, we've found a wonderful alternative use for it as a general purpose mat.  We slip it under my little-one when she's sitting down reading or playing on hard surfaces, and on the grass when we're hanging out at the park, among many other uses.  Another minus of these Dream Blankets is that (unlike the classic A + A blankets), they're not available in organic cotton.  Not a deal-breaker for us, but we definitely prefer organic cotton for any fabric that our daughter is sleeping on, in or with.If you're looking for a muslin blanket that's lighter the A + A Dream Blanket but warmer than their classic blankets, you might want to try the BambinolandOrganic Cotton Swaddling Blanket - Natural - 2 Pack.  They're made of two layers of organic cotton muslin instead of one layer like the A + A classic blankets, and they're just as generously-sized.  We've found them to be suitable for all but the coldest winter days in our area.  (My daughter usually naps in her play clothes, so she's usually in a long-sleeved shirt and long pants on cooler days and doesn't need a super-thick blanket to keep her warm).  It seems as though a winter-warm, lighter-weight cotton muslin alternative the Dream Blanket doesn't yet exist; at least not that I could find on the web at this time.  So if warmth is your top priority and your child is fine with a heavier blanket, then the Dream Blanket is probably your best bet.Grade: B",3

"Baby Trend Double Sit N Stand Stroller, Skylar",I like this stroller.  I purchased on amazon and didn't need to pay for shipping.  It came super fast and was super easy to assemble.  I did it by myself because I didn't want to wait for my husband to get home.  I think it is super versatile and use it daily for walking.  I like that you don't need a bar to use and infant seat.  You just swing down the tray and it hooks my graco infant seat perfectly.  I also think the back seat is super convenient.  I can take it off or put it on easily.  The only think I don't like is that when you fold it up you have to make sure the wheels are a certain way or it won't fold nd you need to take off the front shade for it to fold as well.  Oh well...... no stroller will have everything.... besides if there was a perfect stroller this stroller would have jogger wheels making it THE PERFECT STROLLER!!!!!!!!!!!!,4

Graco Turbo Booster ~ Youth Booster Seat,"My 6 years old daughter has had this car seat in navy/sand color combination for three years now and it still looks like new, well at least few days after I wash the cover time to time. She is able to buckle herself in with ease and she loves the cup holders not only for cups, but also for storing her little treasures. We have taken it numerous times as a check-in luggage on our flights to Europe and in US and it survived without any damage. I have just bought another one for my now 3 years old younger daughter and she is very excited to have big-girl car seat. I also like that this seat is fairly narrow comparing to other types, so I can sit another person in between these two car seats.",5

PumpEase classic forget me not Hands Free Pumping Support for Nursing Mothers,"The Pumpease is a must-have. Before I used this, it was impossible to double pump; every time I tried, one of the flanges/bottles would move or fall. And forget about doing anything else while you pump - Without the Pumpease, all your concentration is on keeping the flanges in place. This bra is also really helpful in creating and maintaining the necessary suction from the beginning. I love that I can just strap this on over an open nursing shirt or nursing bra and don't have to take off what I'm already wearing.",5
Sesame Street Insulated Straw Cup,"The closing mechanism on this cup is hard for me to open, impossible for my toddler to open. We NEVER use this cup!",1
"Snoozy Organic  2 PACK Flannel Cotton Anti Allergy Waterproof Multi Use Pad, 18&quot; x 27&quot;","I bought these pads to lay my baby on in our bed since we cosleep. They have been great for catching milk, drool, and the rare diaper blowout, without me needing to change our sheets every day! The flannel topper is soft and holds up well to frequent washes. I also use them to give my baby some naked tummy time on the floor, or for a quick changing surface in the back of the car. One of my best baby purchases!",5
"Munchkin Nursery Projector and Sound System, White","I bought this when my daughter was about 3 months old and having trouble sleeping. She's 6 months now and I use it every night when I put her to bed. I love it! She falls asleep listening to the music and watching the projections on the ceiling. It works great, plays all kinds of different sounds, and has made bedtime easy.",5
Badger Basket Company Natural Baby Moses Basket with Hood - Blue Gingham Bedding,"Product looks pretty impressive and robust in the picture however its almost unusable because of its quality. The basket is of very low quality material and so as liners n mattress pad. Overall, it doesn't worth $39 at all.",1
Manhattan Toy Dress Up Princess,"I bought this for a 28 month old, who immediately upon seeing it, touched all the different accessories on the doll.  She especially liked the hair and butterfly.  This was noteable since it was the last gift she opened on Christmas Eve.  I figured after the ""Santa Overload"", she would have little interest.  But, I was wrong, she really enjoyed the doll.  A great gift that holds interest and teaches, too!",4
4moms Breeze Playard,"We ordered this playard because of the good reviews we found all over the internet. However, here is our opinion:The Bad:- The bassinet mattress is made of two hard panels that have a big gap in between. Each panel is padded separately, so the gap is pretty noticeable, about an inch wide and runs from head to toes of baby. That is the biggest disadvantage we found;- Since the bassinet mattress is different from the big mattress of the playard, we were not able to find any foams or mattresses to put on top of the cheap two-panel mattress;- 4moms customer service said the mattress is designed that way, there are no sheets available yet to put on the bassinet as of now;- It is a very heavy product, and all the accessories do not fit in the bag. The bassinet and the changing pad have to be carried separately.The Good:- Easy to set up- Nice neutral and modern colors- Good quality materialsFor the price we paid for this playard, we were very disappointed.  The bad items outweight the good and nice look of this playard.  We want our baby to sleep comfortable and that was our priority.  Returning the product was very easy through amazon.",2
Sassy Wonder Wheel,My granddaughter loves this toy it spins nicely and is not noisy like some rattles can be. I would recommend this as a good high hair toy.,4
"Badger Basket Three Bin Storage Cubby, Blue","I have to remove these from my son's room- I can't let him inhale this stuff all night every night. Land of nod is about twice the price, but wish I'd gone with that. I can't imagine what these are made of that they can smell this bad for this long. I've had them about three weeks and it smells just as bad as the day we bought them.",2

Evenflo Splash Mega Exersaucer,"We received this yesterday and I put it together (easy) for my 5 month old. I bought it so we could use it outside. It definitely works for that purpose. With the bottom plastic piece, baby isn't dragging his feet on the ground and getting dirty (which was a concern when we took the jumperoo outside). It's easy to carry (lightweight) and fits through the door with no problem. Baby likes it - he immediately started playing when I put him in the seat. So for all that it's great.But...It doesn't have any music. Which I find strange for the expense of the toy. His jumperoo has music and he loves it! I'm not sure why this exersaucer wouldn't have music. And, if I had thought of that when buying it, I probably would have skipped it.Also, I have to put him in the seat backwards - so that the seat back is holding him up a bit. Because if I put him in it forward facing, he's tipped over a bit too much. I'm sure he'll grow into more but since it says 4 months on the packaging, I expected that he would do just fine in it. I don't find that the case. I guess the seat opening is too big for him maybe (although he's in the 97th percentile for growth).But for the reason we bought it - outside use - this will be great. If we didn't have the jumperoo though, for an inside toy - I'd return this exersaucer - for the lack of music alone.",3
"Graco Pack 'N Play Playard with Reversible Napper and Changer, Roman",Value for money and light weight. This is fold able  one and does not requires much space like other cribs do.,5
"Simply on Board 2 Pack Toy Strap, Black","Do yourself a favor and do not buy this. It's way too short and poor quality velcro that would not hold my boy's Avent cups, not even his plush toy. I ended using it to hold the pacifier.",1

"Graco Affix Highback Booster Seat with Latch System, Atomic",Great High back booster. Good quality fast shipping and my daughter likes it.

Dr. Brown's Bottle Warmer,"One button touch simplicity, just what i needed when the other arm is holding an unhappy infant.Requires periodic cleaning, but that is completely logical and reasonable.  Who does't expect to clean the device used to prepare your infant's food?",4
"Graco SnugRide Click Connect 35 Car Seat, Tangerine","The Snug Ride Click Connect 35 seat really impressed me. Two years ago when we were in the market for a new infant carrier car seat I was very disappointed in the quality of the Graco Snug Ride infant carriers. We had used a Snug Ride with our two older children and we loved the seat. When it came time to buy a new one for our youngest I was unimpressed by the poor quality of the Graco seats. The handles were flimsy and the seat covers were thin and not as nicely padded as they used to be. So two years ago we chose the Chicco KeyFit 22 over Graco. It seems like Graco stepped up the quality over the past couple of years. The handle on this seat is just as nice as they used to be 11 years ago. In fact, I think the handle is just as nice and comfortable to carry as the Chicco KeyFit. The padding for the seat is good. It's not as cushy as the KeyFit, but it's comparable to the Britax B-Safe. The Graco seat has the added advantage of holding a child from 4lbs up to 35lbs. Our KeyFit is only for infants up to 22lbs and was outgrown a while ago. My 18 month old (20lbs 31 inches) fits in this Graco infant carrier with room to grow. The seat must be comfortable because she didn't want to get out of it when she tested it out.  So if you're looking for a seat that will have some longevity, this one will work.The seat is light. It weighs in at 7  lbs which is significantly lighter than our Key Fit and B-Safe infant carriers. That makes a big difference in how long you can carry your child around in the seat. I wouldn't want to have to carry my 18 month old around in this seat, but I was able to carry her when we tested it out.I did find that the canny for the seat, seems to get in the way when you adjust the carry handle.  It is a bit of a nuisance, but there good news is you can detach the canopy if the obstruction really irritates you.  I had similar issues with the canopy getting in the way with our Chicco KeyFit seat, but the problem seems a little worse with this Graco seat.I like the front adjust for the for the harness.  I won't entertain using an infant carrier that doesn't have a harness that can be adjusted from the front.  The carriers that adjust from the rear just aren't practical since it's easier to put a baby in the seat if you can loosen the harness first.Installing the base was relatively easy. It's not as easy as installing the Chicco Key Fit base, but it's a lot easier than fighting with the Britax B-Agile base which is a pain in the rear. My biggest complaint about the base for this seat is there is only one level indicator. If you are installing this seat on the driver's side of the car you will not be able to see the level. I prefer to have a level indicator on both sides to eliminate any confusion. Britax and Chicco both have two level indicators on their car seat bases.Adjusting the incline on the base is as simple as turning the dial on the seat.  It's easier to adjust the incline on this seat than it is to do the same with the Britax B-Safe base.  It's say it's on par with the ease of use for the KeyFit base.Overall, the infant carrier is decent and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.",4
Ikea Baby Bib Set with Sleaves-kladd Prickar,"After reading some of these reviews, I was worried that the bibs would be too flimsy.  Yes, they are lightweight, but so far, they've been great.  They fit the baby well and really keep her clean.  Easy to care for as well.  For the price, they are a very good deal.",4
Gerber Graduates Insulated Sports Tumbler 3-Pack,"I bought these for my 15 month old son when we were transitioning from straw sippy cups to training cups for toddlers. Within his first use, he was using it like a pro - the slightly elevated lip where the liquid comes out helps them to figure out how to hold the cup and drink quite quickly and easily. I'd recommend this product to anyone making the transition! The designs are a cute, added bonus!",5
DaVinci Parker 2-Door Changer in Pure White,"After reading many of the reviews I was hesitant to buy this piece. I had bought the crib and wanted a changing table to match...but worried about the reviews on poor quality. Do not worry however, this is such a pretty nursery staple once together. It DID require two people to put together, if only to hold pieces while others are screwed/tightened etc. Four hands are definitely needed. The shelves inside are not capable of holding too much weight, but are perfect for diapers, wipes, clothing, etc. It looks like real quality and I've gotten many compliments on it. The cherry is just such a pretty color. It also comes with a 1.25"" thick changing pad, but I bought a standard size changing pad and we use that instead. I think the one that comes with it is not adequate for an infant. A very sturdy piece, I am not disappointed at all! It was also packaged great...which is a real plus.",5
Olive N Figs Quilted Diaper Bag with Changing Pad - Midnight Daisies,This is a great lightweight bag and Feels good on your shoulder. Great to carry the basics. Would buy again,4
"Thirsties Duo Wrap Snap, Ocean Blue, Size One (6-18 lbs)","My only complaints with this wrap is that it runs a bit small, and that the velcro wraps seem to fit my son a little better. They are all very good quality, with cute prints. We've used them with fitteds and prefolds, and they work great either way. I've never had a problem with leaks. The gusset at the legs is essential, especially for prefolds, so I really like that feature. I do like the snaps better than the velcro even though the fit isn't as good because my son can't undo the snaps, and the velcro usually starts to look pretty shabby whereas the snaps never diminish in appearance.",5
Ozark Mountain Kids Navy Chevron and Red Minky Nap Mat,I love the mat but I am disappointed that since getting a top loading wash machine it has ripped the mat in several places. In sewing for now because I love it and so does my 15 month old but I don't want to spend the money to replace,4

Farm Scene Wooden Picture Book,"My 10 month old continues to love these books. They come 'tied' with a short rope that is connected with a ball. She enjoys chewing on the ball, especially when she's teething. She also like to hold the ball and shake the book to make the wood pieces clank together.  It's a perfect size for her little hands, but also handy for the diaper bag. We give this 5 stars all around.",5
"ERGObaby Front Pouch, Camel","This was useful on the Ergo, but it's quickly turned into my everyday purse now that I don't use the Ergo regularly. It can hold a lot for a small one and it's a nice everyday purse to throw in my bag. It has an adjustable shoulder strap - I can throw it over the stroller handlebar, in my bag, etc.",5
"Graco Ready2Grow Classic Connect LX Stroller, Metropolis",my wife and I have a 3yr old and a 6 month old and they both love it. The front seat is big enough that our 3yr old daughter can sit comfortably and she can get in and out with ease. The upper seat is very convenient and makes it very easy to keep the baby entertained or fed when he is cranky.Only kinda down side is the stroller is bulky and a little awkward to move when folded. Other than that it's very easy to manuver.,4
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"It would be better if it was easier to get my child in and out, but other than that, he loves it!",4
Edushape Floating Blocks,My 2 year old loved this blocks. The green base is nice because it floats and you can stack all the other blocks on top of it to make a house. We make houses and towers for the rubber duckies.,5
The First Years Deluxe Natural Comfort Breast Pump,I purchased this pump and it initially hurt on the lowest setting as another user experienced too and is very loud.  It does not pump mych milk at all! After about 10 uses the suction began to stop working and still does not work.  I recommend purchasing the extended warranty becasue you will be returning it. I have since bought an Ameda pump which does not even compare.  It does not hurt even on the highest setting and pumps about 4oz in 7 minutes!  Invest in quality!,1
Bee Smart Trike Zoo 3 in 1,My grandson loves his Trike. He loves pressing the buttons on the phone. Greatest 3 in one Trike. Can't wait to see him riding the Trike by himself.,5
"Learning Curve True Fit Convertible Car Seat, Pink Butterfly","I read MANY reviews and felt like I researched convertible carseats adequately and decided this was the best value out there for a mid-priced seat.  I used it for a couple weeks, but just HATED it.  Luckily I called the retailer with all my complaints and the manager agreed to let me return the product.  I don't know how this has so many good reviews, but I am betting most of them come from people who only use this forward-facing.We used it rear-facing, so I really advise anyone who plans to use rear-facing to get another product.  We have a Honda Odyssey and once installed, it was nearly impossible to reach the lever/button to loosen the harness straps while getting him in and out.  The button is squished tightly up against the seat, so you have to blindly wedge your hand down there to find it.  Even once you reach it, the straps were not easy to loosen.There were other minor things with the product, but were not the deciding factor in my returning it.  The instruction manual is awful-- they need to hire someone who knows the English language to document the steps-- all sorts of sentences that made no sense or were wrong.We spent a little more to get the Britax Marathon and couldn't be more pleased!",1
Maya Wrap Lightly Padded Ring Sling - Burnt Orange - Medium,"I got this for my daughter for the new grandson, she raves about it and uses it all the time. Not just &#34;gee, I like this&#34; but &#34;oh my gosh this is so amazing and useful, I don't know what I would do without it&#34;. She has commented on the quality of the product as being top notch too.",5
"Ergo Pouch Cotton Mix Sheeting Sleepsack, White, 12-36 Months","I initially wanted to return the item because it looked so huge, but did not have time to deal with returns. A couple of weeks later, our baby started to roll over and was rolling everywhere in his crib while sleeping. He could no longer be swaddled, so I put the Ergo Pouch on him instead. He slept really well in it and it's a perfect weight on warmer nights. It also looks pretty cute on him. I also bought a Adan Anais sleep sack, but it started to fall apart in just a couple of washes. This Ergo Pouch is much better built with very useful dual zippers. I'm thinking of getting a warmer grade when the fall comes.",5

P'kolino Butterfly Teether Rattle - Orange,"My desr baby has gone through all variations of teethers... And just as i thought there were no other options available, i found this, combining cloth and wood. The size is bigger than expected, but that didn't deterr him from trying to eat the bug completely. I want to think that the wooden wings haven't been discovered as an additional deature to chew on but despite that, the bug is very loved. The only problem is that they are a bit heavy for my almost 6 m.o. but I am confident he will come around them eventually. I would definitely buy it again!",4
"Born Free 5 oz. BPA-Free High-Heat Resistant Classic Bottle with ActiveFlow Venting Technology, 3-Pack","Good, easy to use, the baby has been using this small bottle,Very lightweight, 4-year-old baby he is very easy to hold. thank you!",5
"Razbaby RaZ-berry Teether, Red","With the craze of unnecessary items for children that are over hyped, I decided to purchase one of these for my son when he was younger. Big mistake. He never once enjoyed this device and henceforth, threw it under the couch, and then in the garage. He treated is as if it was extremely uncomfortable for him and he never bit on it at all. The ""berry"" portion of this device is too large for the average infant's mouth.So one begs the question..What is the benefit in this thing?",1
Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo,"I cannot praise it enough. The delight on my 9 mo's face lights up the entire room as she starts jumping away in it. Well built, sturdy and the levels on the little birdies on the poles is adjustable. Little one has a great time jumping to reach for them and they made good chew toys.",5
"Fisher-Price Space Saver High Chair, Pink","I bought this highchair a few months ago and we really love it.  We like the size, and that it is also so compact.  What I don't like is that the &#34;padding&#34; looks much more plush in the pictures, but isn't at all, it is a thinner fabric.  All in all though we really love this high chair.",4
"Medela Easy Expression Hands-Free Bustier, White, Small","This does the job, but I often have trouble with the zipper. I have the item in both medium and larger - in large, the bra does not hold the bottles quite as well, and in the medium, the zipper is pulled tight, so I often have trouble zipping. Still, I would recommend it to friends, and it is well worth the money.",4
Minnie 10 Ounce Character Cup,"I bought this cup for my little diva 2yr old who loves Minnie. It is really cute, but it is not spill proof. If it tips over the straw does not have a 1-way valve, so the drink spills. Also, the handles have to be positioned just right or it will leak out of the sides too (however instructions do tell you this). It also says in the description top rack dishwasher safe, but the cup is printed &#34;not dishwasher safe&#34;.Overall, very cute, just needs a few design changes.",3
Levana BABYVIEW20 Interference Free Digital Wireless Video Baby Monitor with Night Light Lullaby Camera,"I never had this baby monitor b4 but i love it plugged it in and worked right away, and exactly as expected. Ty for this awesome product, i will buy and reffer levana products to my friends ^.^.",5
Moonlight Slumber Little Dreamer Dual Firmness All Foam Crib Mattress,"I originally bought a cheaper mattress that came on special with my crib. It had decent reviews and it was only about 50 bucks, so I thought, great! However, by the time my son was 2 weeks old I noticed he was sinking into the mattress. That seems to be the problem with almost all crib mattresses, but not this one!! I could tell that this was a quality product from the moment I opened the box. It looked and felt like a high-quality product, and I don't think I knew what a high-quality crib mattress should look like before that (1st time mom). My son is now 3 months old and this mattress is still solid! No indentions, no stains, and he sleeps through the night like an angel. Also, I was excited that this mattress has 2 &#34;settings.&#34; Once he's bigger I can flip the mattress to make it slightly less firm for a more comfortable toddler sleep mode. Even though this is pricey, I doubt I will have to buy another mattress until my son moves to a twin bed several years from now.",5
Earlyears Roll n Swirl Ball Ramp,"product as advertised, but ramp feels/looks cheap in person.  the balls are better than expected though, one of the few things that reliably intrigues my 8 month old daughter.  i worry that they could split open and spill the beads, but so far they aren't showing problems.  good to be aware of the possible choking -- wish these were 2"" balls -- definitely don't leave kids alone with them.",3

My First Rosary -20.5&quot; Large Bead Wood,I bought these rosaries for my 3 year old and 1 year old as well as my niece and nephew. It is great for keeping kids occupied during a family rosary. For my 3 year old he is able to follow along with the beads easier than with a small rosary.,5
Bright Starts Having a Ball Get Rollin Activity Table,"My 9 month old has had this table for 2 months so far.. and I'm embarrassed to say that she plays with it for hours a day, though not all at one sitting.  I researched the Fisher Price and V-Tech version of similar tables (and watched my daughter play with them at friends' houses) - this one is so much better!  It seems like there are more activities than the others.  We started without the legs, added them a month ago.  She loves it both ways, and we'll probably take the legs off again soon just to change things up.As another reviewer mentioned, the functionality switches between ""play"" and ""learn"" mode by flipping the page of the book.  There are so many melodies (English and Spanish too) that even after hearing it daily, my husband and I still think we're hearing new songs.  We don't find them annoying at all.  Actually, to correct the other reviewer, the ""red triangle"", ""blue circle"", etc audio corresponds to the buttons of the caterpillar that are the corresponding color and have that shape on them.  It's pretty obvious if you sit down and play with your child.The alligator mouth covers a compartment that is great for hiding the balls or puffs/Cheerios.  My little girl loves to find things there.  She even knows the sound associated with the alligator door and comes crawling to look for food if she hears it.  One of the smartest things that Bright Starts did was to make the 1,2,3 buttons so that they click and pop out.  It's hard to describe, but it's different than just pushing a button - the child gets feedback and it's easier to operate.  Initially, my baby couldn't figure out how to push buttons on any of her toys.  These were easier for her to manipulate and seemed to help her figure out the ""cause and effect"" of the other buttons.Of course, the ball slide is a huge part that sets this table apart from the others.  We have so much fun watching her try to stop the balls from falling into the hole and then chasing them around after the come out of the leg.  The balls are the perfect size for little hands, too.  It comes with six - 2 each of red, yellow and blue.The toy will automatically play a random tune about 30 seconds after the last button/activity was activated.  At first we thought it was broken.  We were wrong - it's actually genius.  I cannot count how many times my kid has gotten fussy or wandered away from the toy and been drawn back by that reminder song.  Just so you know, it's on purpose!  We honestly thought it was haunted the first few nights when it would play songs after we had cleaned up even though no one was playing with it.At 9 months, she has not yet mastered the yellow spinner or the gear-like activity.  She also doesn't reliably let the balls go down the slide on purpose.  Due to this, I foresee her playing with this for at least another year if not longer.  It's really been a lifesaver since she became mobile and hated being constrained by her jumper.  I will say that I got this around the holidays for around twenty-four bucks.  I think the Amazon price is a little high because, according to the packaging, this model is made just for Toys R Us.  You should be able to find it for significantly less there.",5
"Backseat Organizer for Children - Fits Most Cars, Minivans and SUVs - Travel Car Storage for Kids or Babies in Back Seat - Many Compartments for Toys, Drinks, Files, Electronics - Seatback Protector - Money Back Guarantee","This isn't bad for the price, but I should have just gone for something more expensive.  I was trying to find something to attach an iPad to the back of our Subaru seats, and was hoping this would work, but no luck.  The pockets aren't placed right for it to be used that way for a kid in a carseat.  But worse, it wasn't very well made and didn't stay well on the seat.  Maybe I just didn't put it on right.",2
"American Baby Company 100% Cotton Percale Fitted Portable/Mini Crib Sheet, Pink Dots",We needed more sheets for the baby's  bed at daycare.  This sheet is cotton which is so important for comfort and has such bright colors.  I love giving her something special even when I am not with her.  The sheet is soft after washing and kept it's bright colors. A keeper.,5
"Boppy Noggin Nest Head Support, Brown Wheels","This could be a real lifesaver for thise parents whose children love the swing, or are in a car seat, etc a lot. My baby has flat head syndrome and trust me, you dont want to deal with this. The doctors in the hospital or his ped did not ever mention the possibility of a babys head going flat when laying on their backside to sleep to avoid the risks of sids. Putting pressure on their heads can flatten them and the noggin nest can help prevent that. I recommend this item for prevention.",4
Lamaze Soft Chime Garden Musical Toy,My grandson loves this toy- the lights and music intrigue him.  He is very engaged and playful with the musical garden.,5
The First Years American Red Cross Underarm Thermometer,"This ""Themometer"" proves you can't get something for nothing. Fast and cheap never works. This thing never gives the same reading. My baby was burning up and this product gave a temp reading of 98.5, using a real Themometer under the same arm found it was 102.5. This was not the first time this happend but its the last because this thing is going in the trash.",1
Dr. Brown's 2 Pack Natural Flow Y Cut Wide Neck Nipple,"i tried to have my baby skipped a size and went to this directly from size 3, since I forgot to switch to size 4 when the time came.  she definitely didn't like it since its a bit too fast than what she's used to, she spills and chokes on it.  but when she does feel up to it sometimes, the bottle is emptied much quicker and efficient.  she'll eventually use this, and it'll be just easier on everyone.",5

And anyone who didn't want to wake up their child who fell asleep in the car seat can see the importance in this.The Graco snugrider stroller frame, what a great way to be mobile with out having to lug the car seat around. Is a great way to wheel your child into the doctors' office, a stroll around the park, restaurant, or anywhere that you want to go because if he falls asleep you are just a snap way from putting him in the car!Really I am a new mom and this product line is amazing and I can't say anything bad, It is well made and I feel great about the safety of my child.",5
Sesame Street Adjustable Juice Box Holder,I love this juice box holder.  The adjustable top keeps the juice box nice and secure.  The handles are easy for my little one to hold.,5
Britax Vehicle Seat Protector,This is great to protect the seat of your vehicle. It is very easy to install and it does not interfere with the installation of the carseat base. My only complain is that I wish it extended to protect the backrest of the seat as the sides of the base still rub against the seat and it would be nice to get some protection there. Otherwise it is great.,4
"Britax Boulevard 70 CS Convertible Car Seat, Biscotti","My son was almost 1 year old and we had to upgrade the car seat. Didn't know much about the convertible ones I went to the store to see them in person.Only Britax ones seemed to be sturdy and had enough cushion.I went with Britax Boulevard 70 CS;- it had more protection than Marathon (head and lower body cushions insert),- it has clip and click option (it clicks when baby is strapped safe, no need to recheck with fingers between baby and straps), Marathon and regular Boulevard don't have this option,- it doesn't have bulky wide additional support for head like Advocate CS.Basically in the order from the simple model to the most advanced one it goes: Marathon, Boulevard, Boulevard CS and Advocate CS.The Advocate has more protection, but I already have a safe car (Audi and than VW Tiguan) and didn't want to take additional space (the cars are not that huge inside). The car seat is placed behind the passenger seat and there is enough room to sit normal (not like with the infant car seat that is obviously longer).Color Onyx matches nicely black interior.Also considering the cost (Amazon had the best price I found) I think that was an excellent choice.Convertible seats are not that easy to switch between cars and it was harder to install than our Chicco Key30, but now I have one car only so this is not a problem.The seat is set in the medium recline, and it is comfortable for my son to sit and watch the road or to fall asleep.He loved it from the day one; totally different experience to sit forward facing. It was a heart melting experience to see his happiness and surprise. Also when I stop at the lights I can turn my head and see him, give him a bottle, talk, ask questions, sing, make funny face etc.I never installed it in a rear facing position, recommended for up to 2 years old. My son was big enough according to the instructions.The only minus is hand washing and line drying, but unless my son destroys banana I can just wipe it with baby wipes once in a while. Taking the cover off and putting back on it's very easy.",5
"Philips AVENT Washable Nursing Pads, 6-Count","I love how soft and thick this nursing pad is compared to the other cloth ones available! I also like that it doesn't show the typical ""line"" a lot of pads often show through your shirt. The only down side is, the pad doesn't always stay exactly put. In the month that I've owned them, one has gravitated out of my nursing bra, and up my shirt 3 times.",4
PLAYTEX Binky Comfort Flex Pacifier (Assorted Colors),"Received exactly what I ordered. I wish you could specify a color rather than assorted, though.  Should specify boy (blue) or girl (pink) or neutral (green or yellow).Carol Price",5
Avent Magic Trainer Cup w/ Handles - 7 oz - 2 Pack,The cup is alright... it leaks.  I also thought that the cup would have markings of up to 7 oz but it's only up to 5 oz & the rest of the cup is what makes up the 7 oz.  My son took to it easily though so I believe it is a good transition cup.,3
"RECARO ProRIDE Convertible Car Seat, Misty",He babbles constantly in his own language about how awesome this seat is. I'm quite sure he's named it Ricky Recaro.,5
Safety 1st 14 Pack Wide Grip Latches,"Work fine, and fairly easy to install, once you get the hang of it. Great price, and shipped to my door in two days.",5
"Summer Infant Tiny Diner, Pink","I really like this placemat for feeding my toddler. It doesn't slide around, is easy to clean, and has a little pocket thing to catch any food that would otherwise end up in his lap or the floor.",5
"Boppy 2 Sided Signature Slipcover, Vintage Toile","I love this cover, almost more than I love the Bobby pillow! The green side is a lovely soft warm chenille, and feels really cozy. It is a nice mossy green, and though the print side has some pink, it is not so much that it feels overly girl-y. I love that it always seems soft and warm for my baby to be snuggled on top of, and in the very heat of the summer I could flip it and use the cool print side. It washes beautifully, though I always line-dry it so that the chenille stays nice.",5
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,"I bought this pillow when I was four months pregnant and I've had it for a month now. I really love this pillow and it has made sleeping a lot more comfortable for me, and keeps me on my left side. The best thing about this pillow is that you can put it into different positions to accomodate you. Whether you want to sit up, lay down, or prop your feet up - this pillow works wonders! One reason why I did not give this 5 stars is because there is an inner crease/stiching where the head goes, and sometimes if you lay on that area unknowingly in your sleep, it will cause you some discomfort. Maybe wraping the stitched area with a blanket will help reduce the discomfort if you lay near that area. My husband and I share a queen sized bed, and we have no problem with the size of the pillow. He's also able to wrap his arms around me at night as well. Perfect pillow - must get for pregnant women...or none pregnant!",4
Safety 1st Expandable Table Edge Bumper,"My little one is just starting to walk, climb, etc. The bumper fits my coffee table perfectly and is definitely helpful in protecting his little head! I did not notice a smell (which was mentioned in other reviews) and I don't really think it is all that ugly. It looks exactly as it is shown. My main concern was his head hitting the table and corners - The bumper does it's job and protects him as much as it can!",4
"GroVia Cloth Wipes, 12 count","These are the best cloth wipes we've found. They stay soft when wet, pick up the mess like a dream, are sturdy, clean up great and easily, and dry quickly. A must buy!",5
DaVinci Jenny Lind Baby Crib,"This crib is OK.  The wheels and casters on ours broke after 9 months.  We have had it now for 2 and 1/2 years, and everything else seems to be holding up OK.  For the price, it's not bad.  I wish I could buy replacement whels and casters though.",3
Susen 1pc Fashion Cute Baby Kids Girls Boys Stretchy Warm Winter Panda Cap Hat Beanie (Hot Pink),I bought this for by baby and it is made very nice and is so cute! It's fits pretty snug so it will not fall off and will keep ears warm.,5
Safety 1st Prograde Complete Family Thermometer,"It's showing in correct temperature. Regular $4, thermometer shows accurate temperature compare to this one. Never cross 95 degree which is dead wrong.",1
Baby Einstein Baby Neptune Ocean Orchestra Musical Toy,This is my grand baby's favorite toy. Couldn't get him to stop playing with it. He just loves it! So much fun.,5
Medela Spare Membranes for Breatpumps 6 Pack,"I thought my Medela pump in style pump was loosing power (ie: breaking). As a part of trouble shooting the reduction in suction I ran across a sugestion to replace the membranes. When the membranes wear out they stop working as well, which causes less suction and less effective pumping. As any breast feeding mom knows, getting the most milk in the least amount of time is very important, so replacing these membranes periodically is essential. I tried purchasing them at a local store but they weren't available by themselves without the yellow part (and cost a lot because of the extra peices I would have had to purchase). The price was very reasonable, and they made an imediate and huge difference in the amount of milk I could collect. A very easy fix.",5
"Naturepedic Organic Cotton Pillow with PLA Fiber Filling, Junior","Perfect size for my 2 year old!  She loves it, and I love that I can throw it in the washing machine!",5
"Mommy's Helper Bath Mat Froggie Collection, Green, 6-48 Months","I ordered this specifically for my kitchen sink! My back is not the greatest and it's so uncomfortable to wash my infant daughter in the bathtub. I have a very big kitchen sink, but I have granite counters and worried about her slipping and banging on the edge. This bathmat is the perfect size for the sink and it stays safely in place. A quick rinse afterwards and then I let it air dry. It was just what we needed!",5
"Stork Craft Tuscany 4 in 1 Fixed Side Convertible Crib, White",I was looking for an affordable crib for and this one fit the bill. It shipped quickly and was not difficult to put together. It's sturdy and looks nice.,4
Angry Birds Hooded Towel - Red,"I bought for my kid because he begging me.Mybe fits about 3-4yrs.I wish they selling more big kids size! but,my kid loves it,so it is ok.",5
SafeFit Car Seat Leveler,"I bought this product due to the sloping seats in my Dodge Caravan and thought that it was going to be very useful. Boy, was I wrong. When I tried to put this under my infant carseat it brought the carseat so far away from the back of the seat that I was unable to safely buckle it. There was no way to get a tight fit for the carseat using the 1 inch rule. (the carseat should not move more than 1 inch in any direction) I again tried to use the leveler when we converted to a convertible carseat,and yet again no luck. I recommend the poll noddles, they are much easier to use and a fraction of the cost.",1
Evenflo Top of Stair Extra Tall Gate,"I ordered this gate (2 actually) and it arrived on time and in great condition.  However, due to some stairwell architectural issues with our home, these gates didn't work.  One wasn't even opened and one was opened and immediately put back without even opening the hardware.  I contacted the company and was told that I would be charged a 30% restocking fee on each gate and I would be responsible for return shipping.  These gates are very heavy and therefore I know shipping would cost me a bundle.  Nowhere in the description does it say that this item would be subject to a restocking fee.  I contacted Amazon and they told me that the company was charging a ""reasonable"" restocking fee and it was okay to do that any require me to pay return shipping.  With 80 dollars spent on the gates, minus 30% and the shipping, I would be lucky to get 40 dollars back.  Completely unreasonable and dishonest.",1
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey",We used this to cover the edge of some tile rather than a table.  I only wished I would have done it sooner to prevent one injury.  It was easy to install and adhesive is still in place and working well!,5
"phil&amp;teds Poppy Highchair, Bubblegum","Pros:Easy to clean seat, tray, and chair. Straps remove and can be washed in washer.Super lightweight, easy to move around house and take to a friend's house for dinner.Comfortable for baby (30&#34; 20 lbs)Comes apart easily for deep cleaning.Cons:Legs wide, need an out-of-the-way place to put it or I find myself tripping on itStraps don't work terribly well, but the tray holds baby in just fine. We stopped using straps after 1 week and love it.No height adjustment. However, without the tray this can be scooted up to our standard height dining table.",4
Econobum Full Kit,"Of all the cloth diapers I have used, I would have to say I love econobum's covers and prefolds the best! So far I've had no leaks and they even held my son's diaper blow outs! I'm very impressed and very happy with this product. :) This was also my first cloth diapers ever before I tried pocket sunbabys and bumgenius freetime. I would definitely recommend this product to everyone I know.",5
"Comfort &amp; Harmony Portable Swing, Cozy Kingdom",This swing was very flimsy and much too small for our 3 month old grandson. It is light and portable but the quality is not there I returned it.,1
Sealy Soybean Foam-Core Crib Mattress,"I've only had my baby on it for a week, but it seems extremely sturdy and hard yet comfortable.  A good choice for a sort of natural yet very firm and affordable mattress.  I'd have preferred an organic but they were all either way too pricey and/or the reviews said they weren't hard enough to be as safe as a new mother who worries a lot would want.  This was a perfect choice, I think.",5
"Summer Infant ChangeAway, Black","Purchased one and loved the convenience of it so bought another.  I wish I waited as this product was NOT durable.  Both of them ripped at the velcro upon opening.  I do NOT recommend this product, its a total waste of money.FYI, I ended up purchasing one by Baby Innovations which is much better quality, have had it for 6 months and looks as new as the day I bought it.  It also is a little thicker and has padding for where my baby's head lays without adding any additional weight.",1
"Dr. Brown's BPA Free Polypropylene Natural Flow Wide Neck Bottle, 8 Ounce, 3 Count",The bottles are too big and the baby formula leaks out when it's time to heat up. Waste of money.,1
"Gerber Graduate BPA Free 2 Pack Fun Grips Spill Proof Cup, 7 Ounce, Colors May Vary","I have tried several brands and these nuk beakers are my favourite by far. They are truly spill proof even when shaken. I love that they are so simple, there are no fiddly parts so they are easy to clean and you don't spend an hour tracking down all the parts like i have done with others. They are perfect for my now 18 month old who has been using them since she was about 12 months. Easy for her to hold, even in one hand. They are also good value and have lasted very well.",5
Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing - New Nature's Touch,"The swing's fine. It's the second one I've had and I do have to say this is better than the Graco I had. My 1 month old fits better (isn't always sliding down) and it swings both front to back and side to side, which is cool. I have one major problem though. The music stops after a few minutes, and you can't control that. Every time my baby falls asleep the music stops and he wakes up... he does really like the music though.",3
"MAM 2 Pack Original Silicone Pacifier, 0-6 Months, Colors May Vary",,5
Sugar Booger &quot;Vroom&quot; Feeding Collection Sippy Cup,I purchased this cup per authorization from Dr Oz and gave it as a gift. Dr Oz approved of this cup also and therefore I felt compelled to purchase the cups.,5
"Munchkin Star Fountain, Colors May Vary","I bought this for a friend's daughter before reading any reviews.  I put in the batteries and it didn't work.  Then I read reviews about it not working in a lot of cases.  Upon further inspection I noticed that the reason the toy didn't work was because of the plastic parts that are in the battery cavity.  The bottom battery slot was fine, but the 2 slots on the top have plastic to keep the batteries locked in place. If you look closely, you will see that the plastic is too thick and it is preventing the positive terminal of the battery from making contact to the tab.  I simply used a small flathead screwdriver to crack the plastic away from the terminal on either end.  I put the batteries back in and boom, the thing works.Cool toy, bad design.  If you don't mind taking the time to ""fix"" it, they toy is great.",3
"Graco SnugRide Click Connect 30/35Infant Car Seat Base, Silver","I wrote this same review for the Classic connect base - so will provide brief summary here.  Graco uses all the same words and numbers in describing the &#34;Click&#34; and &#34;Classic&#34; Connect products, but that one word is a total design change so none of products are interchangeable.  Buyers of baby gear tend to be unfamiliar with changes, and this led to my two pregnant daughters buying the different versions and grandma (that's me) having to buy two car seat bases.  Very misleading and led to extra costs and frustration.  Car seat/base itself are fine in either version.",1
Fisher-Price Luv U Zoo Jumperoo,THIS IS A CHRISTMAS GIFT FOR OUR NEWEST GRANDSON --GAVE IT A 4 BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE HE WILL ENJOY IT BUT BEING WE HAVEN'T SEEN HIM IN IT YET I AM RESERVING A STAR --I DID PICK IT BECAUSE IT HAD FAVORABLE REVIEWS FROM OTHERS,4
"Graco Ready2Grow Classic Connect LX Stroller, Metropolis","Bought this to replace our 3 year old graco stroller.Wanted to stay with graco so I could use the graco infant carrier that I am now using with my second child. I had not bought a double stroller previously (my son is 3 years and my daughter is 3 months), but my son quickly wanted to be back in the stroller once he realized the baby was riding in the stroller.This was affordable, has so many options for riding the kids, and is't overly bulkly. When it arrived yesterday I was able to quickly put it together with 2 small kids underfoot and we took it out right away. Easy to manuever and steer. Love that I can put the baby in the baby seat or attach the infant carrier. The only thing is that since I have never had a double stroller before it was heavier to lift into the car and takes up more room. I definately would rcommend this product, and it I had trouble finding it in stock anywhere except Amazon, so it must be popular.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I received the Diaper Champ at my baby shower and have been using it since day one.  I loved it when I got it and now that I have used it for 1 1/2 years, I still love it!(First of all, if you have a poop smearing issue in your Diaper Champ, it's because you don't know how to roll a diaper closed and seal it with the tabs.  That's just gross, sorry I had to go there.)  Now that I have made my previous comment, even after the weight of the plunger pushed the diaper down, I have never had the issue of a ""dirty"" plunger.  The only cleaning I do to mine is wipe it down with a Clorox wipe once a week and spray it out with Lysol disinfectant spray everytime I change the bag.  I also use Glad Odor Shield kitchen bags in mine and I have never had an odor problem.My Diaper Champ is still in great condition, never had a broken part and never had a reason to need to take it a part.I would HIGHLY reccomend this to anyone who needs a WONDERFUL diaper pail.",5
Baby Nasal Aspirator Vacuum Suction Pigeon (Made in Japan),"This definitely the best Baby Nasal Aspirator.  Words cannot describe how much I love it.  I use it everyday.  Somehow my baby (now a happy 3-month-old) is congested everyday.  I asked doctor why it is like that.  And the response is ""some babies are just like that.  You just have to clean your baby's nose regularly.""  Since I started use this, no more screaming when it comes to nose-cleaning time.  My baby sometimes even smiles to me afterward, like he is saying ""thank you, mom.  Now I can breath.""  It is a little pricey, but think about how easy it will make your life, it is so worth it.Another thing is that, even you have to use your mouth when use it, all the dirty things will only going to the container, you only use your mouth to create the vacuum.  So no worry about that.",5
Safety 1st Soothing Mist Ultrasonic Humidifier,"It is the best small humidifier I have ever owned.  No filter.  No white residue, I use it at about 50%.  Quiet and easy to clean.",5
"Fisher-Price Rainforest Peek-a-Boo Soother, Waterfall","Loved the product and so did my 5 month-old grand-daughter. The unit came with a few deep scratches on the face, very noticeable, but did not want to hassle with a return and have to wait for a replacement. I understand you would have taken care of the issue.",3
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","Wow, so many things I want to say about this product.First off, I have always dreamed about sleeping outdoors, but being afraid of coyotes, bugs, and rapists, I figured that is not the best choice. So, in an attempt to make my dream come true, I ordered this turtle. And may I say that it defied all of my expectations. As the stars and the moons fill my room, I literally feel like I am sleeping outside. When I pair it with my ocean sounds cd, I am reminded of the days when I would drunkenly fall asleep during beach parties, only to be woken up by the arriving officers after the bon fire has already died out.Not only that, but I get the option of three colors- blue, green, and amber. I go with the green most of the time. The other two are also quite beautiful. It also makes a great nightlight and the plus is that it automatically turns off after 30 minutes, saving the battery. Essential if you have not taken the time to invest in the rechargeable ones.It actually took me a while to choose between the turtle and the ladybug. I decided to go with the turtle to represent Maryland's terrapins, so when my dorm mates ask me why the hell do I have a stuffed toy, I tell them it's all in school spirit.I took away a star because apparently it is an attractive dog chew toy.  The first day my puppy tried to chew on it. To be fair, he is an overly aggressive chewer, and has eaten pretty much every object he comes upon. Unless it's a balloon or a ball, then gets scared shitless...literally. Luckily I caught him in the act, so no real damage was done. But it was a close call.All in all, I can honestly say this turtle has completed my life.",4
Baby Einstein Bendy Ball,my little boby like it very much my little boby like it very much my little boby like it very much,5
Electronic Puzzle Bug,"I bought this along with some other toys for my daughter when she was 1 yo to take on a flight to Hawaii.  It did not keep her attention.  Now that she is 2, she can figure it out quite quickly so it still does not hold her attention for long.  I'm not quite sure for what age this is appropriate.",3
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",This ladybug is very cute. The constellations it illuminates really helps to soothe a child to sleep and keeps them calm even if they wake up later in the night.,5
"Prince Lionheart Deluxe Dishwasher Basket, Toddler",Perfect to wash bigger bottle items and parts of the Sippy cups. I could've imagine how I would've washed my bottle parts without this. It helps out so much and makes My life so much easier.,5
"Fisher-Price Potty Training, Froggy",Very good item. It is simple. Easy to move around.My two-year old son likes it. He almost immediately started using it.,5
"Born Free Twin Pack Wide Neck Bottles, 5 Ounce","I switched my son from Dr. Brown's bottles to these Born Free ones, after learning about the BPA in Dr. Brown's.  At first, these bottles were great!  My son made a very easy transition from the Dr. Brown's to these.  After about 1 1/2 months of use, my daycare provider started having problems with the nipples collapsing.  I have tried everything from making sure the collar isn't too tight, to looking closely at the slit in the venting system.  I can't seem to figure out what is going wrong.  It doesn't happen all the time...just periodically.  I emailed Born Free over 3 weeks ago and I haven't heard back (not very good customer service if you ask me).  Overall, I am glad I am feeding my son out of BPA free bottles, but I wish the nipples wouldn't collapse.",3
Baby Einstein Musical Motion Activity Jumper,"My six month loves this jumper! He hasn't been interested in sitting down since about 2.5 months old. He always to stand so this is great for him. When we received it he was still pretty wobbly while sitting by himself. He wobbled a lot in the exersaucer that we had, but he's very well supported in this seat. He never wobbled at all.He's a big boy so the lowest setting has been just right for him. He hasn't quite figured out the jumping yet but I'm sure he will soon. He likes all the toys a lot and they keep his interest since he can swivel to a new one as often as he wants. The music and lights are a lot of fun.Overall, we are happy with it! We can get short breaks to do chores and he gets to have fun. It's a win for everyone.",5
Sticky Bibs (Your Patented Premium Self-Stick Reusable &amp; Disposable Bibs),"My daughter can be a tiny tornado. She can un-button, un-Velcro, and take bibs off over her head. We always start a meal with a bib but end up needing a change of clothes. I ordered these bibs because they were a good price and I am SO glad that I did. Once that bib was stuck on her shirt she forgot all about it and it saved me from having to change her clothes after the meal. I will most definitely be buying these again when our supply runs out!!!",5
OsoCozy Better Fit Unbleached Prefolds (Infant 4x8x4 Fits 6-16 lbs.) - Dozen,These are soft and the 14 lb + size was perfect for our 4month baby.  However they were NOT absorbent at first.  You must boil them first.  Otherwise very pleased.,4

"The First Years Babypro Quick Serve Bottle Warmer, Colors May Vary","I used this when I was first starting out bottlefeeding. The bottles (resusible) weren't getting enough heat, BUT when I decied to try the disposibles, it worked nice. SInce not alot of warmers alow disposibles, it worked great. All though I don;t use them anymore ( she likes diff bottles better) I plan to use it to heat up her baby food.",4
"Fisher-Price Kick and Play Piano Gym, Discover 'N Grow","My baby girl is completely in love with this toy. I started putting her on this gym mat when she was 1.5 months and she always smiles joyfully whenever she is on it . I thought it was a bit expensive at first, but now i think it's worth every single cent :D . Really glad that I bought it for my sweetie.",4
"Fisher-Price 2-in-1 Projection Mobile, Precious Planet","Bought this for my grandson.  His mom said he loved it every night and naptime.  She never had any complaints about it.  I thought it was lovely with the projection on the ceiling, and when he grew out of the revolving part because he was too big and pulled them down, he already knew how to start the music and projection buttons by himself.  He starts it up in the middle of the night and quiets himself.  When he stays overnight at Grandma's, the musical/projection comes with him.  A snap to attach to any crib and he feels at home and secure.  I cannot imagine the problems others have written about, but we love this item and the many years of service it has so far (30 months).  I highly recommend it.",5
The First Years American Red Cross Soothing Baby Scale,"THE FIRST YEARS AMERICAN RED CROSS SOOTHING BABY SCALE is a good choice for weighing animals because it's stable and just a few inches off the surface you place it on. Repeated weighings indicate that it's consistent.Initially, getting my cat to sit still on the scale was challenging. I cut a piece of fleece to fit the top and placed a non-slip matt between the fleece and the slick scale. I tare the scale to 0 before weighing him. The scale is on the kitchen floor so there's no scary lifting onto tables he's not allowed on. Now he gets onto the scale voluntarily.Even at a Craig's list price, I felt a little ridiculous buying a baby scale for a cat. If weight isn't an issue, you don't need one but weight loss was a concern for my cat.  Because I was able to compile an accurate record as he gained and maintained a healthy weight, I saved the cost and anxiety of at least one visit to the vet.UPDATE MAY 2014: 3 years of daily use and the scale is working fine.",4
Levana LV-TW502 Safe N' See Advanced 3.5-Inch Digital Video Wireless Baby Monitor with Talk to Baby Intercom and Remote Controlled Lullabies,"We've been very pleased with this products performance.  We were unsure at first if it worked because the hand held monitor continually shut off and turned black.  We played with the settings and found out that if you turn off the volume setting the image/display will stay on (like we wanted it too).  Otherwise, only when sound is made wherever you have the camera located, will the monitor turn on so you can see what is going on.Once we figured out how to use the settings we've got nothing but good things to say about the monitor:-  The picture is stable and doesn't freeze up, the night vision is pretty decent as well.-  We don't use it for extended periods of time so battery life has never been an issue - so no complaints about that.-  Our house is about 1300 sq. feet and range or signal has never been an issue, even going out to the back yard or in the garage which is a pretty decent size.-  Lullaby feature by remote is really nice too.I would definitely recommend this monitor and would give it as a gift.",5
"Born Free 5 oz. BPA-Free High-Heat Resistant Classic Bottle with ActiveFlow Venting Technology, 3-Pack","These bottles were great at reducing my granddaughters hiccups but make sure to follow the age rateing.

We intend to use this for our cosleeping 6 mo old, and I feel comfortable that this will greatly improve the safety of our family bed.",5
Nosefrida Baby Nasal Aspirator with 4 filters and 20 Additional Filters,"In my baby's first few months, he had terrible acid and would wake up choking (even if we kept him up at an angle). Milk and/or saliva would come out of his nose and he had this panicked look on his face - it was terrible.  We kept the bulb syringes in every part of the house and he absolutely hated them and I wasn't convinced that they worked that well because he had a hard time catching his breath and they seemed to be irritating his very tiny nasal passages.I'm not sure how I even came across this item, but I read something about battery-powered aspirators so I bought one of those first. It worked ok, better than the bulb syringe, but while researching, I came across the Nosefrida. I read the reviews from other moms and decided to give it a whirl.Thank God!  Although he hates it maybe slightly less than the bulb syringe, this got all of the congestion out quickly and didn't irritate his nasal passages because it doesn't go up his nose. It just sits at the base of his nostrils.  I didn't have to keep using it like I did the bulb, and I also used the saline nasal spray to loosen it up first.  Whoever invented this is a genius. This might be one of my favorite baby products so far.  I only use the bulb now if I have to suction out his mouth, but you can pretty much use this one-handed, holding it like a pencil to the baby's nostril while you put the other end in your mouth like a whistle.  This makes it user-friendly if your baby squirms a lot like mine does.P.S. Don't forget to put the filter in there if you take it out to clean it.  Thankfully, the tube is so long that you likely won't suck it up far enough for any mucous to get into your mouth...",5
"Badger Basket Elite Oval Baby Bassinet, White with Ecru Waffle",I bought this for my first grandchild and it is exactly what I expected.

"Bummis Bio-Soft Liner, Small","These liners make cloth diapering so easy! My husband wasn't a fan of my decision to use cloth diapers, but these have changed his mind. I tried GroVia liners first. They are also nice, but a little rough feeling, so I prefer these Bummis liners due to their softness. They are still very durable, but much softer against my son's skin.",5
Diaper Lotion Potion: Spray,"There's too many good things to say about this product! It smells good and works exceptionally well! It clears up diapie rash very fast! However, you do need to be cautious not to use it when there is an open wound on the baby's bottom.",5
"BOB Revolution SE Duallie Stroller, Navy","This thing is huge!! The front wheel does not fold flat and bulges out. Had to remove front wheels and back wheels to fit in my Expedition. Great quality product, my third child was able to stand on back rail so could push three kids easily. Just not collapsible enough for me, felt bad returning it.",3
"Summer Infant Multi-Use Deco Extra Tall Walk-Thru Gate, Bronze",Exceeded expectations. Best gate we have owned. Easy to assemble. Fits most openings. Read the instructions thoroughly first and measure your opening.,5
"Nursery Fresh Refill for Diaper Genie 4 Pack, 1,088 Count",These diaper pail refills work great in my diaper genie and are cheaper than the diaper genie name brand refills.,5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"I LOVE IT!!!!  One of the best investments I've made as this is perfect to have a permanent gate to keep my 4 maltese doggies in one room when I need to go out.  I tried 3 other gates for this purpose but my one malt could climb over all of them but with this gate she can't because of the vertical bars, there's no way for her to climb it.  Also the pedal opens the gate door very easily, and the door can stay open until I need to close it giving me complete access to the room when the gate is not needed.  The gate is sturdy, well made and the complete package.  Well worth the money it costs..",5
"Regalo Guardian Expandable Gate, White","Though the product details stated that it can fit up to 44inch doors, it actually only measures a maximum of 40inch, hence, it is not able to fit my door of 44inch. However, quality is good and price is reasonable! If your door is smaller can consider getting this :)",2
Electronic Crib Rocker Sleeper for Crying Baby's,I got this bc my baby boy was having a hard time sleeping in his crib at night. When we first open the package it looked cheap and i wasnt sure if it was going to work. but after one night he was having a better time being in his crib. I love the fact that when he would start crying it would turn on. I will have to say when you are not using it take out the batteries bc with all the shaking the batteries start to rust the inside. After a couple of months ours no longer works but thankfully he doesnt need it to go to sleep anymore!,4
"North States Supergate Easy Close Metal Gate, White","I was frustrating with the other kind of gates but when i purchase this one i was very happy , easy to install, both ways opening left and right .Happy mommy .",4
"Dream On Me 3&quot; Spring Coil Portable Crib Mattress, White/Brown",Bought this mattress for the granddaughters' visits.  She seemed to like it well enough.  Had no problems sleeping on it.  It is firm but not hard and fits in the portable crib perfectly.,5
Evenflo Comfort Select Performance Single Electric Breast Pump,"I say - Save your money because if it go bad in one day you will not get refund or exchange.It comes with 90 days warranty but doesn't help.We got the first Evenflo Breast Pump from Target store - Stopped working in 60 days.We got the second Evenflo Breast Pump from Walmart store - Stopped working same day.First one I didn't care until when I went to return 2nd one Wal-Mart, they said they can not return or exchange, I have to call company. when we called company - it feels like I am talking to lawyer. Any thing you say they will find it's your mistake so they can not do any thing.We got this because price is less then others but end up having 2 Evenflo Breast Pump not working and 3rd buying of different company.",1
Disney Princess Castle Dreams 4-Piece Toddler Set,This set is perfect for our daughter's Disney Princess toddler bed.  The only surprise was the pillow case which is standard size as opposed to toddler size like the rest of the set.  It could fit two of the toddler size pillows that we bought for her.  A standard size pillow is simply too big for the bed!  Otherwise it's a great set!,4
Nosefrida Baby Nasal Aspirator with 4 filters and 20 Additional Filters,"This thing may seem disgusting, but it works great.  This is much better then the ball suction things.  The filter stops anything from getting into your mouth.  Wouldn't use anything else to clean our baby's nose.",5
"make my day Silicone Baby Bib, Purple",Easy to wipe clean. Dishwasher safe. Long lasting. Super flexible so can roll up easily to transport. Great gift idea.,5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,The cup area just does not work good for little boys.  Needs a larger cup area to prevent urine from going straight out of potty chair .,3
PottyCover - Disposable toilet seat covers. (6 individually packaged seat covers in each bag.),This potty cover doesn't work well. It always slided off when I tried to put my daughter on the potty.Yuck. I won't buy this product again.,1
Dr. Brown's Drying Rack,"As other reviews have said, this won't hold glass bottles at all, it is not great with 8 oz. plastic bottles, the bottom shelf is very difficult to reach (you have to unstack it to load/unload, which makes all the stuff on the top fall), and it has very little airflow, so things stay wet.Dr. Brown's just wanted to make a little more $ so they put their name on a product that is not all that great.",2
"HALO SleepSack Big Kids Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Red, 2T- 3T","I used these until my son was 3 and then stopped using them sometime in the winter when he was 3.  He is now 4 and hates having blankets on him when he's falling asleep but inevitably wakes me up every night 2-3 times to put the blanket on him since he can't do it himself yet or hasn't figured out how to do it in his sleep :)  So I bought this hoping it would save him from waking us every night and it does.  This is the largest size they make but it is roomy like the other sizes, so I know it will last til he can learn to do the blankets himself!",5
"Boon Frog Pod Bath Toy Scoop,Green",Super awesome buy! I contacted boon customer support as soon as we got our frog to get reinforcements for the back of the frog. They were amazing they sent us an extra piece for the back to stay on right away. You can also go to Boon's website if you have problems with the frog staying on your bathroom wall. Overall amazing customer service and love this item! Everyone wants to know where I got it when they see it.,5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","I have a children's room set up for my grandchildren when the stay over.  It has a trundle bed, a toddler bed, and a crib.  The baby will sleep in a cradle with Grandpa and I.  The children's room is on the second floor.  I use the cot with either a pink or blue nap mat for the younger children to nap during the day. This is great and folds easily an compactly away when it's not needed.",5
VTech Communications Safe &amp; Sound Digital Audio Monitor,"After a year and a half the monitor screen of the parent is blank.  There is nothing...no words, nothing.  It makes me question whether or not the monitor is working properly even with the screen gone.  I use this one with my 4 yr old since he is on the other side of the house and liked the talk feature.  Talking to him still works but even with it set at the highest sensitivity setting I can't hear him open his door and leave his room.  He can be standing outside his room yelling and the monitor won't pick it up but if we are a floor below it, having dinner, you can hear the whole conversation like you were in his room.  Not happy and looking for a replacement",2
The First Years Hands Free Gate,5 minutes to unpackage and install. Pleasantly surprise to seeing it hold up so well against my two dogs. The foot petal requires a significant amount of pressure making it too difficult for my dogs or a small child from opening.,5
"Dream On Me 2 in 1 Portable Folding Stationary Side Crib, Cherry",The only thing that was difficult to find was a better mattress than what came with it. One concern though is that the sides are not quite tall enough for my comfort. My grandson can almost pull himself over the side. Wish the bottom could be lowered a little more to keep him from climbing out.,4
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small",It is very soft. But large for new born baby.  Also recommended .the price is also good for the quality,5
Prince Lionheart Fireplace Guard with Two Corners,These guards are high quality and provide the protection we need for our active grandchildren.  I would recommend them to anyone.,5
Nuby 2-Pack 8 oz No Spill Cup with Super Spout (Color may vary),"My 5 month old really likes it, especially chewing it to ease his gums. I agree with one of the reviews that it would be nice if it had a top but other than that I like that it doesn't spill and baby can easily move it to his mouth and practice drinking. Even though the spout is big my baby didn't choke with the water, he was able to drink just fine.",4
"Skip Hop Bath Spout Cover, Moby",I'd say this is a must have for baby's bath. It was really easy to put on and it stays in place.,5
"Kidz Delight Dinosaur World Of Discovery, Green",This is a great learning toy! I even played with it in the dark and had fun. The only con is that the board is not hard and can be bent easy if not taken care of. I believe it should cost less because of that. I gave it 4 stars because it was fun for all ages and the light was really cool.,4
Zo-li Bot Straw Sippy Cup 6oz,I love this sippy cup!Pros:-durable for my 9 month old. She started using it at 7 months.- the weight at the bottom is great when the water level gets low. (Baby doesn't have to tilt the cup)- NO problems with it leaking or cracking.,5
"Harmony Kids Standard Rocker, Hot Pink","I ordered this chair for my twin granddaughters. Wanted something sturdy and LIKED that it didn't rock as much as an actual rocking chair. They had a rocking bench that they were always climbing on and falling from, because it rocked so much, they couldn't balance themselves on it -- even though, of course, they shouldn't have been standing on the seat.I ordered it for a Christmas gift and was very disappointed at first when it was sale priced but Amazon said it was temporarily out of stock & more would be coming very soon.  Then, suddenly, they said it would be 4 or 5 months before they got stock on this particular chair. I was so upset since time had already passed and it was already mid-January by that time, with my Christmas gift still in limbo. Amazon told me that I could change the order to a different print or color but all they had left then was leopard, cowhide & some other non-girlish print. This would not do because these chairs would be used in the main living room and would look terrible with the room's other furnishings. But, after going back & forth, Amazon came through and suddenly I received notice that the 2 chocolate micro chairs would be delivered to my granddaughters' home in a matter of days. I was thrilled. However, that was on January 18th. Since they live in a different state, I didn't get to see the chairs until mid-February. I was not happy to see that one chair IS chocolate colored BUT the other chair is a very, very dark color - I don't know if it's charcoal brown or brownish black or what. That color isn't even shown as a choice! My daughter thought I ordered them that way so nothing was said to let me know of this terrible difference in the colors of the ""matching"" chairs. Guess now that they're used, nothing can be done.Aside from that, the twins love the chairs.  They do seem very sturdy and, for the price, made well. One can't expect to pay not all that much for a chair and have it finely made, as a more expensive chair would be.  It fits its purpose. The girls easily sit in it and enjoy having snacks in front of the TV and at other times when they are just feeding their baby dolls or playing with a game or just relaxing. They are able to push it to different locations in the room, but it doesn't seem to tip easily or fall over easily.  Aside from the color thing that upsets me, the chairs themselves are really very nice for the money. One thing I might have done differently if I knew what I know now, is that I might have ordered a lighter color, like maybe the tan micro.  I ordered the chocolate because I thought it wouldn't show dirt as much, but I see that it very much shows residue from toddlers' sticky little hands or remnants of a banana or other snack. I know those things don't look as obvious on the lighter micro because I've seen evidence of that. All in all though, I think they were a great buy and I'm glad I didn't have to wait 4 or 5 months for them to arrive. It's so cute to see the girls sitting in chairs that are just the right size for them. By the way, they are almost 2 years old.",5
Waist Belt Extension Strap,"Good for bigger people or over bulky clothes as waist extender, this extender can be used over your winter coat to make the baby carrier fit more comfortably.",5
Ergo Backpack Camel,"The first one of these that I ordered arrived broken, and the second one isn't quite what's pictured here.  Maybe the design was updated as the returned and new ones crossed paths?  Who knows.  The new one has lightly padded shoulder straps, and I have ended up switching to using it as the primary diaper bag, and emptying it out for hiking trips and walks to the park.  It connects fairly well to the ergo carrier, although it only has two connection points - one around each shoulder strap of the ergo.  I think the ""old"" one looked like it may have had four.  It flops a little, but not too bad.  My main complaint is that it hangs a lot lower than I'd like, and the drink pocket on the side is at perfect grabbing height for my 18 month old (this could be good or bad, depending on your outlook - I don't like it b/c I end up getting bonked in the head with his water bottles, or having to retrieve them from the ground).  It's not laid out as well as a traditional diaper bag, but it definitely holds everything we need it to with room to spare.",4
"Innobaby Packin' SMART Keepaa Juice Box Holder, Strawberry",Highly reccomend this product for parents looking to avoid messy juice accidents! It really helped me teach my kid how to drink juice or milk!,5
"Diono RadianRXT Convertible Car Seat, Plum","We love this car seat! It's our second one and this discontinued color price was awesome. We love the color and the fabric doesn't get too hot in the car in the Phoenix area summer heat. The full price is a little high and the weight is on the heavy side but, its the safety of your child so its worth it. The buckles and straps are easy to use and customer service id great answering any questions. Our baby loves it and the new baby will too.",5
CoCaLo Nali Jungle 8 Piece Set,"Goodness, I based the theme of my son's entire nursery on this bedding set after I saw it at BuyBuyBaby. It is absolutely adorable, it's basically gender neutral, though I chose it because the monkey is SO CUTE. My only complaint is that only one window-valance comes with it, and I have two windows.",4
BOB Infant Car Seat Adapter for Chicco Single Strollers,"Does exactly what it's supposed to: secures a Chicco keyfit 30 infant seat into a bob revolution. Installation is as simple as it can possibly be: the whole rig just clicks right into the stroller, and the seat locks into the adapter. Getting the seat in and out is as easy as with the car base: just pul the unlock handle and lift. You can also collapse the stroller with the adapter still in place, although they don't recommend storing it long term that way simply because it can leave an imprint on the fabrics of the stroller. For sticking in the trunk of the car or checking as baggage on a flight, it's totally fine, though.I'm always a little wary buying cross-brand adapter products and the like, but this fit the bill perfectly and has made the Revolution we bought a full-cycle stroller. Way better than multiple strollers!",5
Tiny Love Sweet Island Dreams Mobile,"My baby fall in love with this mobile when she was 1 month old.Now she is 4 month,still laugh and scream when she play with it.Amazing toy for babies!",5
KidCo Peapod - Cranberry,"The product may seem a bit weird at first as it looks more like a tent then a crib, but it works great!Best of all, of course, is it's size. When folded it is very small and easy to carry around",4
"American Baby Company 100% Cotton Sweater Knit Blanket, Celery/Gray ZigZag","This pretty gender-neutral (pale green/gray/white) blanket is just the right weight for newborn summer use.  Other reviews mentioned it was rather small (30"" x 30"") but I personally like this size.  There's enough room for swaddling and because it is isn't bulky, the blanket is ideally suited for car travel.  It washes up nicely and retains softness.  The blanket is knitted cotton.  American Baby Company recommends drying flat, but I have not had any problems tumble drying it on low.  It comes attractively wrapped with a pretty gray bow.",5
Mokingtop Fashion Cute Baby Girls Boy Newborn 0-12 Month Knit Crochet Clothes Photo Prop Outfits,"This picture was clearly stolen from a photographer because what i ordered is in no way shape or form the same butterfly. The colors are great but the back is all one piece, not disconnected pieces like in the picture. Also the most dissapointing thing of all is the hat, the antennas DO NOT stand up like pictured, in fact they are just little floppy tassles. Also the hat is so enormous it fits on my 2 year old and shes in the 100th percentile for head circumference! Needless to say this is a terrible purchase and i will NOT be using it on my new born baby!",1
"Aden by aden + anais 2 Pack Muslin Security Blanket, Safari Friends - Giraffe","Perfect Blanket. My daughter (4 months old) loves them. She snuggles them against her cheeks before drifting off to sleep. Fabric is breathable, and blanket is small, so you don't really need to worry about suffocating (even though I still give them to her only during naptimes so I can monitor, or when traveling in her stroller). They are very soothing. Material is super soft, especially after each washing (gets softer and softer).",5
Protect-a-Bub Deluxe 3-in-1 Sunshade - Single - Black,"I am so happy with this 3-in-1 sunshade.  It is easy to put on, easy to use and easy to adjust from full coverage to top coverage.  My baby was bothered by the sun in her eyes and would wake up if the sun was shining on her face.  I do not like the idea of putting sunblock on her sensitive skin, so this sunshade is the perfect solution.  This is a must have in Southern California.",5
"Bright Starts Portable Swing, Up Up &amp; Away","This swing is down right dangerous. I should have read all the negative reviews before going the cheap route with this piece of junk.  I'd give it a negative star if I could.No matter what I do, the baby is slumped in the chair, with her head pushed to her chin. Obviously not safe. I waited a couple months to see of it was just her size, but alas, nothing has changed.  I'd return it if it weren't such a hassle to send back.I don't feel I can even resell this in good conscience.UPDATE:  Amazon made it really easy for me to return the swing despite having thrown out the box...so I replaced it with another inexpensive swing: Fisher-Price Space Saver Swing and Seat, which is perfect.  No slumping, no worries.Fisher-Price Space Saver Swing and Seat, Discover'N Grow",1
Milkies Milk-Saver Breast Milk Collector Storage BPA Free,"I love my milkies milk saver. it's not just a milk saver, it is also a breast saver. I absolutely dislike pumping and am saving up to 6 oz a day now that my milk has come in just from placing it in the non-nursing side while nursing my 2 week old son. I even put it in one side and pumped the other and i got more milk in the milkie than i did in the pumped side!It is a little bulkier than it looks in the picture but fits in my nursing bra even though i have large breasts. A great investment for all breastfeeding mothers and mothers to be.",5
"Itzy Ritzy Snack Happens Reusable Snack Bag, Rodeo Drive","love these bags to use in my large diaper bag that doesn't have any compartments. they are great for snacks, toys, or any other little items that might get lost in my big bag. they are great!",5
"Boppy Luxe Newborn Lounger with Slipcover, Pastel","This Boppy Luxe is really great! I've used it for myself as a prop up pillow (but its very thick and firm), babies love to lounge in it, but I would have to say that my two cats are constantly FIGHTING over which one gets to lay in this pillow! I do not have children yet but my cats are obsessed with this. If you have a baby and cats, buy them each their own!",5
"Munchkin Travel Bottle Warmer, Gray","I was very impressed with this warmer. Yes, like some of the reviews stated it takes a while to warm up a cold bottle, but you just compensate by warming the bottle before your baby is screaming for food. We recently went on a twelve hour trip and took a cooler and this bottle warmer. I could make a bottle and whatever my son didn't eat, put in the cooler to warm up for him later. It would work very well with pumped breast milk while traveling.",4
"Joovy Zoom 360 Swivel Wheel Jogging Stroller, Blue","Pros:- Smooth ride- Attractive style- Vibrant color (we bought blue)Cons:- Seat doesn't sit up tall enough for my child's comfortReclines fine, but my daughter would like to sit up straighter than this seat allows.  We make do, though!",4
Safety 1st: Rockin' Jitter Buggy,"I was going to buy little tikes, but when I got to the store I saw this and HAD to have it. I have a four month old baby boy and I thought this was perfect for him. This was not hard to put together at all. I was so amazed at how easy it was and my baby just loves it. It is a minature car that vibrates, bounces and has tones of different sounds for his enjoyment. He sits in it and plays with it all day long. What else can I say, but I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!",5
Baby Jogger POD Stroller Kit,"We purchased these wheels because the stroller was going to be use mainly for walking around with my 3 kids, love the easy to control hand bar.  Brakes are in the back permenantly in the back tires, so no need to detach when transferring.  Fits in our Prius and our Sequoia. Wish these bad boys came free with the purchase of the Jogger!!",5
"green sprouts Organic Knitted Terry Bib, White, 3-Count","The picture is of a striped pink and white jumper but the description says 3 white bibs, too afraid to order as I need bibs but DO NOT want that jumper.",1
"Britax B-Ready Stroller, Black","The only thing this stroller does good is roll when pushed. I debated 2 or 1 star but when I thought about the price of stroller I decided 1, bc for the price I feel really let down. Of course Amazon does good deals but consider what this stroller goes for full retail price-I would be super angry if I would have paid full retail. When you fold the stroller you either pinch you fingers or slam on your foot. This happens to me and my husband. The wheels are so big that it does not fit in the back of my Tahoe unless a seat is folded down. It's also quite heavy. And perhaps my biggest complain is how you have to unclick the infant carrier to get it out. It leaves both of your hands barly holding on to sides of carrier which you then have to set down to be able to grab handle of carrier, which I consider design flaw. But it did comes with wheels, so I don't have to carry baby so I guess for that it gets 1 star, lol.",1
"Europa Baby Geneva Convertible Crib, White","My wife and I had been shopping around for a while for our first crib. I was skeptical of the quality of a crib at this price point. I was convinced we would have to spend $400+ for a good crib. This crib was delivered on Saturday. We had it assembled in under 30 minutes. The quality of materials and construction is excellent. I am very impressed with crib, and we saved a bunch of money by not having to get a higher priced crib. Can't wait for baby to come along to sleep in it!",5
Tiny Love Symphony in Motion Farm Animal Mobile (Styles May Vary),"In general, this mobile is fine.  My baby does enjoy it very much.  It can entertain her for quite a while if she's not in a tired mood.  It is true that it is a very large mobile and the noises can become annoying for adults.  But she doesn't seem to mind.My main complaint is that it needs a master on/off switch or an on/off button that is out of reach of the baby.  My baby is very into kicking her legs.  She even kicks in her sleep and the kicking causes her to roam all over the crib.  Lately, her kicking has been landing on the on/off button of the mobile and so it turns on at 5 AM and wakes her up upon which she wants to play!  Ugh.  She now thinks of it as a game to try and turn it on and off.  We have tried putting the mobile at the far end of the crib but as I said, she roams all over the crib - starts out on one side at the beginning of the night and ends up on the other in a few hours.The other thing that I wish the mobile did was actually help my baby get sleepy.  I had read so many books recommending turning on the mobile to help baby get to sleep.  And this mobile came with suggestions that suggested one of the music selections for bedtime.  But there is no way my baby would sleep if this mobile was on.  It is purely for playtime purposes.  Not sure this is the fault of the mobile though but rather my baby's temperment?Anyway, overall I am happy we got this.  It was a shower gift.  I think it has served us well.  It probably isn't going to stay up much longer though if my baby keeps using it to wake us up at 5 AM.  :)",3
Summer Infant Baby Touch Digital Color Video Monitor,"My brother bought this for us when we had our first baby a year and a half ago.  In the beginning it would say no signal all the time and we had to resort to all kinds of ridiculous tricks to try to get it to work, turning it on and off, moving the camera around, etc.  After a while, it started working better after it had some time to ""warm up"" or something.  Then it started to work consistently until we took it on a trip and then it started to give us the no signal again for no apparent reason.  After that we bought a cheap sound only monitor for trips so that we could leave this one in place and hope that it would continue to work.  It works the majority of the time but continues to give us the no signal screen momentarily every once in a while.  We then got a second camera for our second baby.  It worked great the first month but now it starts giving us the no signal after about 15 minutes.  I have to keep turning the video on (the screen goes dark automatically when it's not on it's base, presumably to save the battery) to make sure I'm still getting a signal.  It's so stressful!  My brother also bought one for our sister and she is going to return hers because it not only gives them issues with the signal but also seems to be interfering with their wireless signal as well.  It's so great when it works, the picture is very clear, the sound is good, it's user friendly, and I love how you can control the camera.  The scanning feature is great and syncing is very easy.  It's just unfortunate that it's so very unreliable.  This product has caused us no end of frustration!",1
"Luvable Friends Baby Bib With Waterproof Backing, Pink, 2-Count",Great bibs very soft and the Velcro lasts through the washes. The pocket is great for catching all of the food my daughter drops and they absorb liquids very well.,5
"Munchkin Bottle and Nipple Brush, Colors May Vary","after owning this for only 6 weeks, the floppy sponge at the bottom fell apart and the nipple cleaner broke off and won't reattach to the rest of the brush. mind you, I breastfeed almost exclusively and use this maybe twice a week to clean out bottles after I pump to run errands.the brush does a so-so job of removing the separated solids that collect from breast milk on the side of the bottle.",2
"Tiny Love Take Along Mobile, Animal Friends","This mobile has 4+ ways to mount it.  We've attached it to the car carrier, we've attached it to the Graco pack and Play, you can attach it to a drawer, chairs, etc.  If you need this in a weird location you are only limited by your creativity, not the design of this mobile.",5
Lilly Gold Sit 'n Stroll 5-in-1 Combination Car Seat/Stroller,"It's a shame, this is an otherwise a great product.  However, unlike regular car seats that strap into a car from the back so that you can leave the car seat in a car and take the baby in and out without much trouble, this seat requires the seatbelt to strap OVER the baby!  This is not only uncomfortable for the child, but a hassle because the seatbelt has to be undone and redone each time you get out of the car or every time you take the child out of the seat in the airplane.  This may not seem like a big deal, but reaching over the child every time to find the buckle can be difficult and time consuming, and very uncomfortable to the child.  I will not use this car seat again, I am very disappointed.",2
"Munchkin Nursery Projector and Sound System, White",My kids have been sleeping with white noise since they were born. This works great and adds the plus of a nightlight and projector if needed. Is has a timer if needed but my kids like it on all night and the timer left off. I ended up buying a second one to keep the kids happy.,5
"Munire Medford Convertible Crib, White",Waited so long for this to come back in stock. Finally the crib came and we opened it to put it together on the day she turned one month. I can't get over how beautiful this crib is!But... The two side railings of the crib each have a one inch gash in them. :( SO disappointing after all this waiting. We now have to get in touch with Amazon to see where to go from here.Inspect yours carefully if you order it.,4
"AllerZip Waterproof Bed Bug Proof Zippered Bedding Encasement, King DEEP Size (Fits 11 - 18 in. H)","I bought this bed encasement based on great reviews and I am going to have to agree with them. This cover is very comfortable, quiet and keeps everything out.I love it!!! It is easy to clean and has no weird smell (as other covers do)I recommend it to anyone!",5
Diego Traveling / Folding Potty,Awkward fit on public restroom seats. Not sturdy for daughter to sit on and has fallen into toilets!  Yuk!!  Waste of money.,1
"Gerber Birdseye 10 Count 3-Ply Prefold Cloth Diapers, White","I am using these as burp rags and not as diaper, so this review is for the use as a rag.  At first, I did not like these as much as other drapers I got since I think they are rather thin.  I've been using them on the changing table to cover up the outfit quickly after a new change of clothing.  My baby rejects other cloths that are too thick but these actually do not bother her.  I like others, but this is a great thickness for this usage.",4
Baby Safe Ink Print Kit - Basic,I never take the time to review things but this item was such a mess I am going to review it. It is okay for a foot print... Very stubborn to remove ink totally even with baby oil. But it is horrible for a handprints!!!! My baby still has ink in her nails from it!! Horrible mess to remove it and the remaining ink still won't budge!,1
"The First Year's Infant To Toddler Tub with Sling, Blue","I agree with the reviewer who said this tub is a perfect shower gift. I received it as a gift and my friends who threw the shower used it as a punch bowl to serve punch from at the shower. I know it sounds weird, but it was adorable - even had a rubber ducky floating in it!But that's not why I love this tub. I love it because my 5 week old daughter loves it! She can be totally fussy, but when I put her in the tub right before bed, she calms right down. I know a lot of it has to do with being submerged in warm water, but I think the sling helps a lot too by cradling her and making her feel safe. I love the clean water area on the end, but I wish it were a little bigger. I use a plastic cup to get the clean water out to pour on her, but it's a little tight.Overall though I love this tub! I have recommended it to many friends.",5
"BABYBJORN Travel Crib Light 2, Black","I recently purchased this travel crib, but have not had a chance to use yet.  I did go on youtube to see how the bed is put together and taken down and it is easy enough to do.  I looked at the Phil and Ted's travel crib but there seemed to be way more to it as far as putting together etc.  The babybjorn is light like they say and puts together in seconds.  The fabric seems durable.  My daughter is almost 4 months old and I plan to have her sleep in it a few times before our vacation this spring.  Hopefully I can provide a better review after that trip happens.",4
Britax Back Seat Mirror,Love this. My old car doesn't have a headrest in the middle seat so I needed a mirror that can be put on the side headrest and turn towards the middle. My only complaint is that I wish the mirror was slightly bigger.,4
"Harmony Kids Standard Rocker, Hot Pink",Its so cute. My 14 month old loves it! I would buy it again and would recommend this item. Thank you!,5
Nook LilyPad Playmat (Poppy - Bright Orange),"Very well made, easy to fold up and take along. No oder to the material. is vented as well. Bright color for stimulation.  Provides a layer when the floor is cold.  Love this product",5
Monkeys Swinging on Vines Giant Peel &amp; Stick Nursery/Baby Wall Sticker Decal,"I have a slightly textured wall. The design mostly sticks ok, but some areas are pulling away from the wall. Other than that, the monkeys are adorable.",4
Peg Perego Prima Pappa Diner High Chair,"We ordered this chair in April 2006 for our then 4 month old. She is now 11 months old.  We have been very happy with this chair so far.  It's not too bad to clean, you just have to really dig in there and the cover does come off so that helps.  We just recently saw a crack coming in under the tray and the cushion where baby's bottom goes has a huge tear where it split right at the seams.  Our baby is only 19.5 pounds and not super active in the chair.  We ordered from Amazon but will try to return to our Babies R Us Store.  Stay tuned.......we probably will try another chair and see how that goes.",4
"Lifefactory Sippy Caps for 9-Ounce Glass Beverage Bottles, Set of 2, Raspberry and Royal Purple","After originally posting a review with 1 star, I am now upgrading the caps to 2 stars based on the fact that they fit on regular bottles.When I bought these the valves prevented any liquid getting through and then the manufacturer suggested that I squeeze the valve's spout before using it. Hey presto, it worked! There is no mention of this on their website nor on the little info sheet in the packet. Moreover, after washing them, the valves get stuck again so often that I have resorted to squeezing the spout every time before I put them in. This is not so bad in comparison to the fact that they have no lids so if your baby doesn't finish the bottle, you have to remove the cap (very messy and impossible to do with a squirmy baby in arms) and stick something else on with a watertight cap! This is because the caps can leak even when screwed tight.",2
"Safety 1st Oven Door Lock, Decor","Read how the adhesive strips come off and detach, but we took the time to scrub and clean the area first. Dried it well, and they stick very well. May be overkill, but since they also cone in 2 packs, I bought 2 and put them both on the oven door. They work great. Metal construction is strong and looks nice. If they are still working in a few months, I will gladly change it to 5 stars.",4
Clek Olli Paul Frank Multiple Choice Booster Seat - Blue,"I absolutely love that this booster latches in.  My little one loves the Julius print.  It appears to be much more comfy than other backless boosters - it has a thick cushion rather than just the cover over plastic.  If I had to find a negative aspect, it would be the lack of true cupholder - instead there is a stretchy mess pocket on one side that will hold a drink or whatever.  It did not fool my 4-year who pointed out the lack of true cupholder.  Still, I love it.  The latch system trumps all!",5
"Britax Frontier 85 Combination Booster Car Seat, Red Rock","I bought this and took it to a car seat installation workshop held by the CHP.  The LATCH works great-- no issues there, except that LATCH only goes up to 40 lbs with a Britax seat.  Eventually we would HAVE to use a seat belt if we wanted to continue to use it to 85 lbs.  It took the professionals 45 minutes to install it correctly in my 2005 Altima due to two things:1. The integrated head rests on my back seats make it difficult to position the car seat squarely in the car.2. The buckles of my seat belts hit right at the plastic part of the Britax, making it really difficult to pull them tight enough.We ended up sitting in the seat while installing it to push it all the way to the back (to get past issue #1), and then they had to twist the buckle around before connecting it so it would get tight (to resolve issue #2).  This was not reproducable at home.A third CHP came over to see what our issue was and said, &#34;My daughter has this exact seat and we have the same problem in our car (not an Altima).  As soon as she outgrows the LATCH, it's trash.&#34;  If that's what the professional is saying, I'm not even going to try to keep it.The car seat is nice, and if you have bucles that sit flush with your seats, you may not have an issue.",3
Chicco Keyfit Caddy Stroller Frame,"When I got my Chicco Keyfit30 for my newborn granddaughter I took a pass on this caddy - instead going for a traditional Graco &#34;luxury&#34; (ha ha) stroller.  Well I soon found out that didn't work very well - having to take her out of her car seat and transfer her into a stroller just was not working for us.  Now all I have to do it pop out the carrier, click it onto the caddy and away we go!  No more waking her up for the whole unbuckling and transfer process.  Then when done with errands, pop her off the caddy and click her right back into her car seat - no fuss, no muss!  I do think if you can only afford - or only want one stroller - go with a traditional one as it will last a lot longer and you will get more use out of it but this Chicco Caddy sure is handy.  It is also very light and easy to handle (folding and unfolding a snap) with a generous storage backed underneath.As an aside I got a great deal on this with amazon prime - list was $99 but I got an &#34;open box&#34; for $79.  Was in absolutely perfect shape, inside packaging was still intact - only thing was the top of box had been opened and resealed.Thanks.",5
"Ciao! Baby Portable Travel High Chair, Black","I saw this in a parent/child magazine.  It is perfect for going to Grandmas and Picnics,  We are heading Up North for 4th of July and this will take up so little room in the back of the truck.  I was so amazed at the quality of the product.",5
Star Kids Snack and Play Travel Tray,"This table sure does help with car trips. There is more room than their lap to spread out things to keep them occupied. It is easy to put on and wipes off easily. I only have a couple of complaints:The pockets are very difficult for my 2.5 year old to reach. If something is tall enough and sticking out the nearest pocket, she can reach it. But, if it is something at the bottom of the pocket or in the front pocket, she has no way of getting it. We end up not using them at all. I don't foresee her being able to reach them for a long long time.My other complaint is how much it slopes downward at the back (from the child's perspective). Crayons slide out of reach as well as other smaller toys and snacks. I wish there was an angled pad underneath or something to keep it more level. I know it can't be stiffer because of safety reasons, but I don't see how angled padding would be a problem!Overall, I find that this helps with long car trips. I especially like it for meals on the go. It definitely has its flaws, but I have not seen anything similar without those flaws! I recommend this.",4
"Simple Wishes Hands-Free Breastpump Bra, Pink, XS-L",I pumped for almost a year with my first child and I just held the pump parts or propped them on my lap.  I rigged up a sports bra with holes but it just didn't work well enough.  I got this on sale just before my second child was born and it's great!  I've never lost suction while moving around in the office and I can keep typing/answering the phones with no concerns.,5
"Innobaby Five Tier Packin' Smart Storage System, Sweet Green Honeydew",My wife got this not quite 3 months ago and already four of the five containers are broken.  The plastic is hard and brittle.  They've cracked just from falling on a hard surface.  She is going to try customer service to see if they will do anything for us.They say not to put them in the dishwasher.  Two stars because it does work nice for small snacks.,2
"Dreambaby Stroller Fan, White/Blue","I'm so upset I bought this product. In theory, it's a wonderful concept. But we used it 3 times and it's stopped working!!! We only used it for about 20 minutes at a time and there is just NO excuse for something breaking after an hour of use. Don't waste your money.",1
Fisher-Price Sounds'n Lights Monitor,I have only had this brand new dual reciever set for about 3 months and already one of the recievers is broken. We have to turn the volume so far down on this reciever to avoid static that we hear our child first before we hear him on the monitor. Probably a great monitor when you use only one reciever and plan on never switching it from room to room. All in all ---&gt; DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,1
"Go-Go Babyz Sidekick Deluxe Diaper Bag/Baby Carrier, Wood Green",Its a great concept and I was hoping it would work. Very uncomfortable! Diaper bag is small and impossible to get into with child in carrier.,3
Woombie Mo'Mo Friends Pacifier Holder &amp; Security Blanket (Lola the Bunny),"I have two of these for my little girl. I keep one in her crib and one in the diaper bag for travel. She can find it at night when she wakes up this saves us from multiple trips in to her room to &#34;replug&#34; her. It does a great job of keeping the pacifier attached! My only complaint is the satin material does show wear pretty quickly. If you are looking for something that is going to follow your child in to toddlerhood it might not be for you. For us, it was perfect..adorable and nicely priced!",4
Munchie Mug - Top Rated Spill Resistant Snack Cup for Toddlers. Ages 1 to 4 years. Made in AMERICA. - BPA and phthalate free. FDA compliant materials. - Blue Top,This snack cup is great...  better than anything you could find in a local store. My 18-month-old son loves it and wont eat cereal of crackers without it anymore. It is simple to clean and has a cute design.,5
"PBnJ baby Paci Holder, Big Pink/Purple Dots","totally in love with the design its so cute,The colors shown on the internet are a match to the eye in personi used before Booginhead pacifier chains and they are the same but with cute design ,used daily, washed many times and are still like newhighly recommended",5
"Pop Pals Ice Pop Holders, 2 Pack, Blue/Green",Perfect to keep little hands from touching the cold freeze pop.  These work well & can be washed easily.  Definitely recommend.,5
"Diono RadianR100 Convertible Car Seat, Dune","Love this seat, fits great in my Prius, since I have another car seat in there its a tight space, easy to install and it also comes with a great safety rating. Highly recommend seller!",5
Mommy's Helper Contoured Cushie Tushie Potty Seat,I run a childcare and really like the children to be very comfortable using this seat. I would buy again.,5
"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Bath Thermometer Alarm, Green",I didnt want to burn my child nor did i want to make him hate bath time because it was too cold. This item works great. I would recommend to any parent.,5
PlayPen Netting for Insects &amp; Bugs - Protect your Child's Playard (28&quot; x 43&quot; x 25&quot;),It works great! it covers the top and all four sides so bugs cant get in! Keeps baby safe! we have used it on our two different play yards and it fits both great!!! So far ive not found anything wrong with it. my 3 month old is always safe from bugs in it when we go to the beach or to grandmas house n her back yard!,4
Yummi Pouch (Set of 6),"I love these. I always buy the applesauce in the pouches for a quick on-the-go snack but they can be kind of pricey. I looked these up and bought them. I am very happy with them. They are a nice size. The one downside is that you have to be very careful not to overfill them or they sort of leak (at least with applesauce). Once you get the hang of it though they are awesome. I don't know if they are 'child approved' as I have no kids and just use them for myself. However, I have run them through the dishwasher and everything and still going strong. Highly recommended.",5
Forest Friends 5 Piece Baby Crib Bedding Set with Bumper by Carters,"I am INLOVE with this set. It is very well made, pretty and comfortable. My baby's nurseryLooks fantastic with the entire collection of forest friends.",5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,I have researched every gate on the market at this point.  So far we are extremely happy with this gate.  We wanted pressure mounted gates but I was concerned that the opening of this particular gate would not be wide enough for my husband.  I thought that he would have to turn sideways to get through the door and would not like it once used on a regular basis.  So far we are very satisfied customers and my husband can walk straight through the opening so the width meets our needs better than I anticipated.,5
"Wee Gallery Art Cards for Baby, Peek-a-Boo","I highly anticipated these cards, and I'll admit I was still a little surprised at how much my son loves looking at them.  I love to show him a card and watch him study it.  When his eyes finally look away (after 15-20 seconds), I flip the card around, and all the sudden he's interested again!  He's only 3 months old now, and I hope he continues to enjoy them.",5
"Tiny Love Take-Along Arch, Sunny Stroll",She enjoys playing with this toy and no longer gets fussy in her car seat. I have a Peg Perego car seat and it grips on nice and tight. Easy to put on and remove.,5
"Infantino Flip Front 2 Back Carrier, Black","little guy did not like it, if your baby is long, dont bother with this one. also the design is not structured to support from the hips which leaves most of the weight on your shoulders",1
"Super Undies! Bedwetting Pants, The Web Slinger (Red), Small","My son and daughter use these Super Undies night trainers. My daughter is almost 5 and pees about 3 out of 5 nights, but she never leaks through these. She wears a size large and they fit her very well. I think they will continue to fit her through 6. They do not leave red marks and she finds them comfortable. She does wake up and know she is wet though. She ends up taking them off, dropping them on the floor and going back to bed. I'm fine with that!My son is 8 and wets the bed all the time. He has been using these since he was 5. They used to have a different style back then, but it is pretty much the same thing. He is in size XL right now.We changed him over from L when he was turning 7.  We fold the insert in thirds in the front to give him more absorbency. Every once in a while he leaks, but most times he does not. It is still better than using disposables (Which leaked all the time) I have twoSuper Undies Mattress Topperfrom Super Undies as well (my favorite of all the products) and two waterproof sheets. Between these pants and the mattress stuff, I am totally prepared to handle this bed wetting thing until it stops... which may not be any time soon!",5
"Taggies Luxury Plush Blanket, Sweet as a Bug",I got this blanket bc it said it was very soft!! I bought this for my 9 month year old daughter. I wish I bought a different one bc it isn't soft at all!! I have triplets and I bought  the other ones a taggies blanket and theirs was so soft!! I wouldn't recommend this!! Not happy waste of money!!!,1
"Carter's Laguna Hamper, Teal/Tan, 17  X 16 X 27&quot;",Super cute and functional laundry hamper. Love it for my son's nursery but will be cute when he is older too.,5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,"As an exclusively pumping mom, my 2 month old spends a lot if time in this chair. The vibrations soothe her and she stares at the waterfall. The chair is sturdy and I can bounce it with my foot. We use a boppy head support with it bc I'm worried she'll get a flat spot.I think there are some kinks with this bouncer. I do hear a clicking every once and a while, and twice the activity bar seems to have shorted out. Both times that happened it worked fine the next day.UPDATE: The motor started clicking then the vibrations got lighter and lighter until they disappeared even with fresh batteries. I called Fisher Price about it on a Monday, and a new motor arrived on Thursday of the same week. The bouncer has a one year warranty, and it could not have been easier to get a new motor since I had already registered the product with them. I am changing my review to 5 stars bc the customer service was so great.",5
"The First Years Babypro Quick Serve Bottle Warmer, Colors May Vary","There is variation in heating, sometimes It takes two cycles to heat and sometimes the two cycles make it too hot. (I am very considerate on the use of water though). Still learning on the optimum usage tricks but none so far. Product itself is good, nice quality, small cord (probably meant for side tables use). Okay with this product.",3
"Itzbeen Pocket Nanny Baby Care Timer, Blue",I have to say. I didn't expect for this to help so much. I always had to remember this things but now I don't have anymore. I just love it and I don't need to even think about when and what. I just wish they had memory for maybe 24 hours so you can look back and see exactly what happened that day. But other than that I love it! Very easy to use.,5
XL Clean Guard,"I bought this to lock up my cleaning supplies when my Daughter started walking.  She's very curious and into everything, and thinks everything is for her mouth.  This doesn't lock, but it's child proofed enough my Daughter should be past the 'mouthing' phase by the time she figures out how to open it.  It's tall enough to fit bottles of Windex and other cleaning supplies, and is easy to carry from room to room.  It serves my needs perfectly, and keeps my Daughter out of the cleaning supplies.  Great product.",5
"Plush Panda Bear,Bamboo Panda 17&quot;","The perfect gift for anyone. I bought it for my 17 year old boyfriend and he loves it. He's named it Fang Ping, and takes it around everywhere, even to school. I thought he'd be embarrassed by it, but he loves how huggable and soft it is. The gift note I added on to it was written on the cutest stationary, and the nose is cute, pointy, and made of leather. Would definitely recommend to others.",5
Sesame Street Elmo Car Seat Cover,"Cheap material, doesn't fit the seat well, absolutely no cushioning.  Had to place over old car seat cover, and can see the old car seat through the material.",1
The Piggyback Rider Standing Child Carrier - NOMIS Basic Model,Super comfortable and my 2 year old loves it! I take him with me when we go hiking looking for shed antlers in the mountains. Makes it easy!,5
"Evenflo Nurture Infant Car Seat, Jenny","This car seat is fantastic. My daughter was a 5 pound preemie and fit in it fantastic! Now she's 9 pounds with colic and its one of the only places she's comfortable and sleeps! Its sturdy, cute and reliable. Highly recommend.",5
"Skip Hop Duo Deluxe, Black","Overall, a good product -- plenty of space, and made with durable material.  My only complaint is that the main compartment doesn't stay closed very well.  The main compartment has a magnet closure at the top, rather than a zipper or fold-over flap that would keep it closed more securely.  However, the bag's long, thin shape works very well as a messenger bag or bag that fits over the stroller handlebars.  I also like the straps that are included that fit over the stroller handlebars with a quick release closure.",4
"Babymoov Bebedelice 5 in 1 Baby Food Processor, Blue/Purple","Water is leaking at the bottom within 3 months, the motor is not functionable after the leakage of water.  It's not reliable and worth it.  $60 for less than 3 months.  Don't buy!",1
"Evenflo Jump and Learn Developmental Activity Center, Frog",One of the hanging birds fell off within the first week and had to be sewn back into the toy....my son is 8 months old and this jumper is still too tall for him. He is just barely able to touch his toes to the bottom on the shortest setting. We've had a pillow under his feet for 3 months! The toys seem to keep him entertained but he appears to like the jumper he also has much better...,3
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I used these bottles when I decided to supplement with formula at 3 weeks.  My daughter didn't really have any problems switching back and forth between the breast and bottle.  She is completely weaned at this point and doing well with these bottles.  I am glad I decided to go with the 9 oz bottles from the start, as she quickly went from 4 oz to 6 oz and I would have had to buy new bottles if i had originally purchased the 4 oz bottles.  We had some minor problems with leaks, and then I actually read the instructions that came with the bottles.  The secret is to reassemble the nipple/ring while the nipple and ring are still wet.  That seemed to solve our leaking problems.  I would highly recommend these bottles to anyone.",5
"Baby Buddy Secure-A-Toy, Navy/Red",Great quality item and price for something that helps immensely with keeping the snack cups on the stroller and car seat. Just snaps on and we are ready to go! No more snack cups falling on the ground.,5
"OXO Tot Bottle Brush with Nipple Cleaner and Stand, Green","Being a first time mom, I'm just not familiar with a lot of products.. I receieved this item as a gift, and did not use it until a month after the baby was born!  I just thought the brush was way too big to fit into any of my standard size bottles!  But that wasn't the case.  All I had to do was push the soft, yet firm, bristles into the bottles.  Give it some twist and turns and voila! clean bottles!  I use it on medela 5oz bottles and Dr. Browns standard flow bottles (both 4 and 8oz bottles), it works and cleans wonderfully.  The only thing is the nipple cleaner.. it's quite hard and doesn't really clean the nipples very well.  But over all, I give this product an A!",4
VTech Communications Safe &amp; Sound Digital Audio Monitor,"This is a beautiful cardigan that I was so excited to receive. However, unfortunately the photos are definitely not even close to being accurate.  In person this item is the most hideous shade of green.  Not even close to mint.  If you have your heart set on Mint do not even consider this cardigan.",2
"The Original CJ's BuTTer (Unscented, 12 oz. tub)","Best natural baby diaper ointment. My son has a sensitive bottom and we've tried more ointments then I can count trying to find one that protects his skin. But this one is the only one that keeps my boys bottom rash free. We love it and we love the othee scents that are offered especially the coconut lime dream and mango sugar & mint scents. They are non irritating to sensitive skin. A little also goes a long way, a tub usually lasts us 2-3 months.",5
ERGO Sport Carrier - Black,"We started carrying our baby in the ERGO Sport at about 4 months and still do now that he is almost 16 months (and 24 pounds). He often prefers the ERGO to a stroller ride, and if we are going a long distance it gives me a nice workout! The very padded shoulder straps and very soft fabric make it comfortable to carry your baby or toddler even for long distances. I am a small person and at first thought the ERGO was too bulky for me, but it doesn't appear bulky once the baby is in it. It is also a great way to calm a fussy baby; when our son is acting emotional and needy I pop him in the ERGO (even at home) and the closeness calms him down instantly. It is hard to figure out, at first, how to wear the ERGO, and I didn't find the instructions that  came with it very clear. However we eventually figured it out, and now are very glad that we made this somewhat expensive purchase. Our ERGO is black; if I had it to do over again I would get the carrier in another color, as the black shows every little stain.",5
"Chicco Cortina KeyFit Travel System, Chevron","I bought this as a gift for my son and wife before their baby was born. Someone had recommended Chicco and I went with it. What I did not understand was that this carseat is only good for babies up to 22 lbs. and that they sell the same travel system with a different car seat. Very confusing and somewhat misleading!!!.. Our little one is almost 20lbs at 8 months. She only has a little more time in this seat. Sooooooo, because it was my stupidity, I feel compelled to get them the carseat that will last them until she is 30lbs and then, at an appropriate time, transition into a front-facing seat.  That is an expensive mistake. Why would anyone buy the 22lb carseat, except in error? If anyone ever asks me about Chicco, I will have to make sure they purchase the system with the 30lb seat. Who uses the 22lb carseat?",3
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Rainforest","I use it for travelling with my daughter to restaurants or parks. Helps her sit up and eat. Very light weight, strong plastic. I like it.However, if you have a high chair.. this has less use. I bought it mainly for travel.",4
"Nursery Fresh Refill for Diaper Genie 4 Pack, 1,088 Count",why spend the extra $$ on name brand when this will do the exact same thing? faithful fan of this product.,5
Philips AVENT Newborn Starter Set,"We have been using the Avent bottles for our son, and have never encountered the leaking problems that others refer to.  We have been extremely happy with them.  The best way to put the tops on is mentioned right in the instructions.  Put the cap on and tighten only as much as you can by turning the cap.  Don't tighten the whole top.  I would recommend them.  Good Luck!",5
"Thermos FOOGO Phases Stainless Steel Straw Bottle, Pink/Purple, 10 Ounce","We bought these for a airplane trip because I wanted some way to close the top completely while traveling (our normal sippy cups don't have a lid). These are great but are not like a sippy cup (not that they purport to be), they leak if held at a downward angle or upside down WITHOUT the lid on. WITH the lid closed, they don't leak at all.",5
Combi Flex Lightweight Full-Sized Tri-fold Stroller in Black/Wasabi,I bought this stroller in March 2008.  It was great light weight stroller and had all the bells and whistles we were looking for when we first bought it.  Then shortly after it went downhill from there.  The under carriage basket rubs on the back wheel even when you put light items in it.  After a little wear and tear the wheels started sticking and didn't maneuver as well as they used to.  Now the stroller won't fold at all the mechanism that is used to fold it completely failed.  I had to stuff it in the back of my trunk fully open.  I expected a little more from this stroller and thought it would have had a longer life for the price we paid.,2

"DaVinci Kalani 4-in-1 Convertible Crib with Toddler Rail, Cherry","I was extreme excited to find this crib at a barging. I received the crib in 3 business days, which I was shocked at how fast it arrived. It was extremely easy to assemble, and looks beautiful in our nursery. I did however follow the words of caution and handle each piece with caution to avoid scratching the finish. I piece of the crib did receive some contact from a screwdriver, but finish stayed intact.  I would recommend this crib!",5
Doidy cup - Turquoise,We bought this cup for my 5 yr old daughter with Down Syndrome who still struggles with drinking form an open cup because of tongue protrusion. She has been opposed to drinking from open cups but she liked this cup. She is able to see as she is drinking and drink slow without spilling. The shape and handles of the cup make it easy for her to use.,5
"Boppy Infant and Toddler Head Support, Grey","My daughter has developed a flat spot on her head, and this does seem to be helping.When she lays on the floor her head is proped up well. The material is super soft, it seems to be made really well and looks just like the photo listed.However, If you're buying this for a carseat, I would reccommend something else. This DOES NOT fit in our Graco Snugride carseat. I still love the product so far, it seems to really be helping.",4
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I really like this sheet!  It keeps the rest of my son's crib sheets dry, so easy to take off and clean. I have two so I just wash one and use the other.  Especially great for those nighttime leaks when you just need to change baby and the sheet and get back to bed!",5

Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Projector Soother,This is a great toy music is just a little too loud but my 5 month old son loves it,5
"Contours Options Tandem II Stroller, Tangerine","I am probably as happy with with tandem as I could be with any tandem.  We got it for those occasions when a side-by-side would not fit through the door.  It is easy to unfold and re-set.  I have not been able to fold it down with both seats attached, and it does take some extra time to take off and put on one of the seats.  It is looooong! and it is hard to lift the front to go up and down curves.  The boys sit pretty comfortably.  They are 16 mos old now.  They will grow out of this stroller before they grow out of strollers in general, but by then they will be able to walk into the places we needed the stroller to get into.",4
"Fisher-Price Healthy Care Booster Seat, Green/Blue","I live in Australia, feeding booster seats are comparitively expensive here. as they are not so popular in Aus. with delivery i paid $39 (worth the price) from amazon. love this product would recommed to everyone. small and compact can fix it on a chair or use it as it is. my daughter loves it when we both sit on the floor and she is in her seat. she feels i am close to her. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",5
Milkies Milk-Saver Breast Milk Collector Storage BPA Free,"I am a mom of 5.  I dont know how I managed to breastfeed my first 4 babies without a Milkie!  I used to leak, spray and gush milk, which would get soaked into a nursing pad or handtowel.  What a waste of breastmilk!!  Thanks to the Milkie, I can freeze a minimum of 16 oz a day without any effort! I love, love, love this product!!",5
Summer Infant Day and Night Handheld Color Video Monitor with 1.8&quot; Screen - Silver,"I purchased this item in April. Although I was pleased with the visual monitor, the sound components were less than satisfactory.  By the end of May, the sound was no longer working.  Amazon.com is wonderful and the item was returned and replaced very fast.In October, we had the SAME ISSUES with the new device, the sound no longer works. The monitor is a great idea, they just seem to have deceptive components for the sound.",2

Clay Hanging Keepsake Kit (Makes 2 Plaques),"This is relatively easy to use and the result is nice. They send you everything you need for the project. I made an impression of my baby's hand and his foot quickly and relatively easily (it took two tries, but the clay didn't harden up as I rolled it out for the second attempt). They weren't perfect, but I wasn't about to torture him to get it exactly right. The impression is shallow, not deep, and looks pretty much exactly as it's pictured.",4
Bright Starts Sweet Safari Bounce-a-Round Activity Center,my daughter likes is but I don't like the fact the u cant incline it to when she's going to be a little bigger she's 6 months right now and she feels uncomfortable when she is sitting. I wish is had that thing to make it taller.,2
Britax Frontier Booster Car Seat,"Car: 1998 VW JettaKid: ""almost 3""year old boyIt was time to do the car seat tango and upgrade the oldest kid, and hand down to the youngest.  Our son had been riding in the Britax Roundabout for the last (almost) 3 years, and we loved the seat - clearly superior to anything else we've seen out there.  We decided on the Britax Frontier because it should be the last car seat he needs and can go from a 5-point harness style to a booster style when he is ready.  Very cool.  Little man is also into the gadgets - cup holder and arm rests, and apparently it is quite comfortable as he seems to fall asleep in it every time he rides in it.  The quality of construction is obvious and it is definitely on par, if not exceeding, our faithful Roundabout.However, I was concerned about the reviews about the difficult installation, and I was not let down.  It was a pain in the...Since we have an older car, LATCH was not an option so we were left with the shoulder belt method.  I spent a couple hours trying to get that to work to no avail.  Short way, long way, and other ""creative"" solutions.  I could get it tight, but it could just wiggle loose with no effort.  Until a little research unearthed the trick - pull your seatbelt all the way out.  The belt should then go into a ""retract only"" mode so it can't wiggle loose!  Exactly what this seat needs.  Between that and the tether on top, the seat stays reasonably secure.  I am mechanical engineer by profession, which doesn't mean I'm smart, but it does mean I am pretty up on how things fit together/work, and this was a wholly non-obvious installation.I do feel like the Roundabout has a vastly superior installation and belt retention setup, so why they went away from that is beyond me.  Assuming I never need to move the seat again, it is great.  We all know you always need to move them eventually, so hopefully next time I need to install it, it will be much easier.And finally, Britax has amazing customer service.  When I called about the difficulty of my installation, the woman I was talking to, grabbed a Frontier and walked out to the parking lot to install in a co-workers car fairly similar to mine.  A big thumbs up to Britax customer service!",4
"Evenflo Portable BabySuite 300, Marianna","I bought this as a crib alternative for my 9 month old. She was getting too big for the rock n play to sleep in but I don't have room for a crib right now.  This is very lightweight but sturdy.  The colors are nice and vibrant and it has a lot of options (changing table, bassinet) for different ages/stages for baby.",4
Sesame Street Teething Baby Blanket,"my 4 month old loves holing this blanket and chewing on every part of it. it is soft without shedding """"fur"""". its nice that it clips on the seat and stroller. the stock photo makes it look quite a bit bigger than it really is though.",4
"ERGObaby Original Baby Carrier, Galaxy Grey","I've taken my baby on many trips now, accompanying my husband on business trips and visiting extended family all over the US. All of this traveling would've been awful without this crucial little item. Moving through airports is a breeze, she sleeps very soundly in her carrier so she hasn't missed a nap no matter what crazy stuff I've been doing, and I've had my hands free to take photos in all the amazing places I've seen with her, from Manhattan to New Orleans to Seattle. She's remained safe in big, bustling cities, and easily brought off the beaten path on all manner of trails in the forest. I simply wouldn't be able to live the way I do with an infant any other way.",5

"Evenflo Tribute Sport Convertible Car Seat, Willa","Don't love it, but I like it. It's good for the price. I'd recommend it as an extra car seat for grandparents, sitters, etc. You usually get what you pay for and that's true in this case. It's not very cushiony, but not too hard and has no cup holder or any extras like that.  My 8 month old doesn't really like it, but she didn't like initially getting strapped into her infant seat either and it was awesome! We had a Britax :)",3

Kiinde Kozii,"I love my Kiinde Kozii!! I have a four month old baby.  We decided to breastfeed for baby's health (not to mention the money we save).  He is an eater!I am happy for a healthy baby, but his healthy appetite can be a problem when its time for a two , four, and six am feeding.  My wife works over night, and I work early mornings on most days.  So, the faster I  fill his stomach and can get back to bed, the better.  I can grab a frozen bag of breast milk, heat it to the perfect temp, and feed baby before I really wake up.This wasn't around when my older kids were his age. It was much more difficult then.  I'm no expert, but our breastfeeding consultant informed us it is  really easy to damage the milk by applying  too much heat.  Steam is a lot hotter than needed for heating something going near my baby's mouth.The Kozii takes out all the guesswork and timing.  If you are a dad, and you love sleep. Its a no brainer.Kiinde Kozii",5

"Graco My Ride 65 LX Convertible Car Seat, Rane","This carseat has worked well for my daughter. My husband was able to install it fairly easily in our car and I love the cup holders. I also enjoy all the head rests and cushions that came with, those would be better for smaller babies. Our daughter likes riding in it, she has plenty of room. The belts take a little bit of getting used to but now it takes 5 seconds to get her buckled in. I would recommend this model!",4
"Munchkin Precision Fit 24&quot; Gate, White","Love this gate!! My 11 month old son is soooo energetic and loves to climb the stairs. I bought two of these gates and they are perfect! I also use them when we open the sliding glass or front door it is the perfect fit. Only problem was the metal peice where the bar falls into bends easily! You just have to make sure you done put it in place to tight, easy to bend back! Would recommend this to family and friends with little ones!",4

PureLan 100,I starting using the lanolin in the first few days then stopped because I thought it wasn't working. I quickly realized how much it aided in the moisturizing of my nipples because they began to crack. I then went back to using the lanolin and they healed immediately. Highly recommend using this product and don't stop until the first week or 2!,5

"Boppy Pillow with Brocade Slipcover, Black and White","The boppy can be used in variety of ways (propping,feeding. Tummy time , and sitting) which I love. Currently my LO is 9weeks and I use it when she takes short naps and to have her sit up to digest.  Just for feeding I would recommend breast friend  over boppy because it's very sturdy and it doesn't flop like boppy and the tips don't get flat which calls for other pillows to be used for support.Minus star for getting all linty when washed. The slip cover looks like it had multiple washes and old after first wash.",4
